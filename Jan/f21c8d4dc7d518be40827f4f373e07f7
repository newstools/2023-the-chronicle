The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter VILLAGERS from Tsholotsho who are based outside the country have approached local leaders seeking to be involved in developmental programmes in the district. A huge number of people from Tsholotsho, just like Plumtree, reside in neighbouring South Africa and Botswana and a majority have built mansions at their homesteads back home. Some have undertaken various projects around Tsholotsho in partnership with Government and the rural district council. A meeting was held in Tsholotsho recently and it was attended by over 150 people based outside the country as well as local authority, Local Government and Public Works Ministry officials and local political leaders. Traditional leaders were also represented. Each ward in Tsholotsho has a committee representing people living and working outside the country and their representatives attended the meeting. At the meeting, the diasporans pointed out that communities struggle to access social services and are sidelined on job opportunities as people from other areas are employed ahead of them. They requested to be given opportunities to be involved in development of the district through various projects. Tsholotsho South legislator Cde Musa Ncube and her Tsholotsho North counterpart Cde Sibangumuzi Khumalo organised the meeting with the help of the district development coordinator Aaron Gono and Tsholotsho Rural District Council. <img class="alignnone wp-image-597428 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Musa-Ncube-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Musa-Ncube-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Cde-Musa-Ncube-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Musa Ncube “We came up with the idea of meeting diasporans to focus on development and opportunities and we invited them through the DDC and RDC offices to make it clear that this was not political. Their cry has been that they work with us but they are not recognised in local government or given space to invest home, and sometimes they are not aware of the right procedures to do so,” said Cde Ncube. She said the meeting resolved that the Diaspora Policy will be shared with committees and they were encouraged to start companies to get tenders to do projects in the district.  “It was a fruitful meeting and it tried to close the gap between them and local government as per their concerns. They were not happy and we agreed to let bygones be bygones. Sons and daughters of Tsholotsho who are based outside the country have done a lot of projects in the district working with local government and we are grateful for this,” said Cde Ncube. She said they have repaired and constructed bridges especially in Magodola. They have also built Nkunzi Clinic and police post, constructed three small dams in ward 19, built Mbamba Clinic, Malanda Clinic, Nanda Dam, Mbalibali Secondary School and a science laboratory at Zibalongwe. The diasporans are also mobilising resources to build a Civil Registry office at Tsholotsho centre. Cde Ncube said the involvement of people in the diaspora is important for development and will complement Government efforts towards development and attaining a middle income society by 2030. Mr Wilmon Nkomo, a businessman from ward 18 who is the local coordinator for the diasporans, said the idea was a result of the realisation that Tsholotsho lags behind in terms of development even though it is endowed with natural resources such as wildlife, forests and others. “We are grateful that the local leaders are trying to help change mindset of people with regards to investing their money. Their idea is to work with Government for development which is why they have requested to be involved in local projects,” he said. Local businessman Mr Minutewell Ncube, who is the chairperson of the small and medium enterprises chamber for Tsholotsho, said the diasporans play an important role through remittances and supporting local business. “We have many people in neighbouring countries and far afield and they all want to participate in local development. Their concern is that they have been doing projects but they are not given enough space and recognition. “To us in business these people are key stakeholders because we tap from their remittances so their involvement closes the gap and this might see them investing in tourism, wildlife and other sectors,” he said.-@ncubeleon
