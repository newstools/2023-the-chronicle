GOVERNMENT has approved Hwange Local Board’s 2023 budget and rejected proposed budgets for Binga Rural District Council and Lupane Town Board. The other councils whose budgets were also rejected are Murewa and Karoi Rural District Councils in Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West respectively. The Ministry of Local Government and Public Works has so far approved 2023 budgets for 92 local authourities.
In a statement, Hwange Local Board (HLB) said following the approval of its budget, new tariffs came into effect on 1 January.  “Hwange Local Board would like to advise members of the public and other stakeholders that the 2023 council budget has been approved together with tariffs and other service charges. Council is aware of the plight of residents thus in coming up with the budget it had to balance between improved service delivery and tariff affordability. HLB would also like to take this opportunity to encourage residents to continue paying their bills on time,” reads the HLB statement. Government has directed all councils to produce by-laws by January 31 to support their budgets. It further urged them to upgrade their Enterprise Resource Programme (ERP) to the Local Authorities Digital Systems (LADS) to improve revenue collection. The sole purpose of LADS is to improve the operations and competence of local authorities. <img class="wp-image-612130 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Budget.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Budget.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Budget-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: iStockphoto In a statement, Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo said most local authorities finalised their final accounts, which are ready for auditing but there seems to be delays by private auditors appointed by the Auditor General. “We acknowledge that most local authorities have initiated or completed their property valuation process. Councils are urged to undertake general valuation rolls in order to establish their property values which subsequently improves their property tax,” said Minister Moyo. — @skhumoyo2000
