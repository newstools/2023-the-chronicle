The Chronicle Raymond Jaravaza, Saturday Chronicle Correspondent ELECTION promises to revamp two of Highlanders’ properties are yet to be fulfilled judging by the state of ruin the buildings owned by the club are in, Saturday Chronicle can report.
Current Highlanders chairman Johnfat Sibanda, in his election manifesto that ushered him into office in 2021, made pledges to renovate the club’s properties. A visit to Hlabangana Lounge by this publication earlier in the week paints a gloomy picture.
Once a vibrant weekend hangout joint that attracted the who is who of Bulawayo’s social life and contributed to the club’s coffers through rentals, Hlabangana Lounge has been turned into a ‘squatter camp’.
Not so long ago, Hlabangana Lounge, run by Bulawayo socialite Babongile Sikhonjwa, was the place to be for social events, weekend hangouts and even attracted out of town party lovers. <img class="wp-image-652604 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Johnfat-Sibanda-at-Anfield.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Johnfat-Sibanda-at-Anfield.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Johnfat-Sibanda-at-Anfield-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Highlanders chairman Johnfat Sibanda Sikhonjwa paid rent to Highlanders as the owners of the property.
The deal went south in October 2019, when the popular outdoor joint was shut down by the Bulawayo City Council (BCC), allegedly due to licensing issues.
The property had been vacant until about three families moved in.
One lady we spoke to said she is the wife of one of the grounds men that are working to restore training grounds. “My husband works here and is employed to fix the grounds. We moved here because we didn’t have a place to stay and this building was empty at the time,” she said.
True to her word, on the periphery of the land that Hlabangana Lounge sits on, three men were hard at work on a football pitch that used to host social soccer games.
Asked if they pay rent, she professed ignorance and said only her husband could answer that question.  The three gentlemen refused to talk to this publication.
Our next stop was Hotel California, a house owned by Bosso in Luveve suburb.
The house offers accommodation for out-of-town players that sign contracts with the Bulawayo giants.
The caretaker who identified himself as Ndlovu said only three players stay at Hotel California and they are frantically searching for alternative accommodation. “The geyser doesn’t work and there are other problems such as leaking pipes that need to be attended to.
“The house has three bedrooms with bunk beds that should accommodate at least 14 players but for now only three boys live here. They are currently at their homes because of the holidays,” said Ndlovu.
A player who spoke on condition of anonymity said players shun the house because it’s designed to resemble a boarding school. “First team players don’t like that place because it’s like living in a boarding school where we are expected to sleep on bunk beds like school children. There is no privacy at all,” said the player.
Highlanders chairman Johnfat Sibanda said plans to revamp the two properties have always been in place even before he become the head of the current executive. <img class="wp-image-670708 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/yiujmkhjmhj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/yiujmkhjmhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/yiujmkhjmhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hotel califonia (Bosso) “Even before my time as chairman, when the late Maphepha (Ernest) was in charge, plans to renovate the two properties were always there so its only a matter of when we will forge ahead with those plans.
“Something will be done about the properties top bring them to acceptable standards, to bring them to a level that is satisfactory but all that depends on funds,” said Sibanda.
