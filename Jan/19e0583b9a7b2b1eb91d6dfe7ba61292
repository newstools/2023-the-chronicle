Club secretary Tavengwa Hara confirmed that their bustling forward was being targeted by the Rwandan side.
“Yes, it’s true they wrote a letter to us. That is, inquiries were made by the Rwandan club Gasogi United which is seeking the services of our player Brian Muza. All I can say is negotiations are being held between the two clubs,” said Hara.  The veteran football administrator added that: “We are happy for Muza that he is getting recognised after his debut appearance in the country’s top flight league. That he is being recognised in his one year in the Premiership, is exciting for us as a club. If proper procedure, satisfaction of the club and more importantly, the welfare of the player are met, we will not stand in Muza’s way. The player has to be happy and proper rules have to be followed. We should not compromise the value of the player just because it’s a foreign team that wants to sign him. In the meantime, Muza has to keep on working hard and get more recognition.” <img class="wp-image-674406 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bcgfcg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bcgfcg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bcgfcg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Brian Muza In a letter addressed to Chicken Inn from Kigali, Gasogi United chairman Charles Nkuriza Kakoza said:
