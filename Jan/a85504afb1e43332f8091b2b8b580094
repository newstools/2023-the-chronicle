PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday donated wheelchairs to people with disabilities in Bulawayo as the Second Republic keeps true to leaving no one and no place behind in its inclusive development agenda. The President launched the country’s National Disability Policy on June 9, 2021 in Harare. The policy, which was developed with support from various stakeholders including the United Nations, seeks to address the marginalisation and discrimination of persons with disabilities (PWDs), empower them to improve their own quality of life and enable them to contribute towards the national development agenda. <img class="size-large wp-image-673719" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wef-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wef-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wef-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Wheelchairs Donation From ED The policy sets standards for the inclusion of PWDs in all facets of life, thereby serving as an overarching policy framework on disability across all sectors, including the public, private and development sectors. President Mnangagwa’s donation was a follow-up to last year’s Zimbabwe National Disability Expo which was held in Marondera. Yesterday, 10 wheelchairs were handed over to the beneficiaries while 10 others are yet to come for distribution.
Speaking during the handover ceremony yesterday at the Bulawayo Polytechnic College, Mr Macnon Chirinzepi, who is a director in the Office of the Special Adviser to the President on Disability, said this was an initiative that the Office of the President and Cabinet undertakes every year to empower people with disabilities. <img class="size-large wp-image-673716" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fgxgfxgf-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fgxgfxgf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fgxgfxgf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We conducted our disability expo last year in Marondera which ran under the theme; ‘A participatory and inclusive society which leaves no one behind,’ where President Mnangagwa donated wheelchairs to PWDs throughout all provinces of the country,” he said.
