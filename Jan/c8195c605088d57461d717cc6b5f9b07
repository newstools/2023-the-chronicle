The Chronicle Flora Fadzai Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter MORE than 200 residents received free medical services offered by Heath Ambassadors for Economic Development in Pelandaba suburb on Saturday . The weekly outreach programme which started in January last year, is meant to benefit vulnerable members of the community such as the elderly who cannot afford to pay for health services. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and counsellors offered various services during the outreach.
Beneficiaries pleaded with the health ambassadors to offer such services regularly saying many of them could not afford to pay for health services or buy medicines. Mrs Elizabeth Ncube (70) from Iminyela suburb said she could not believe it when her grandchildren told her that health officials who included doctors were providing free services. She said she was given all her diabetes and high blood pressure medication.
“l am really happy l got free medicine because these days medicine s are very expensive,” she said. Mr Eddington Mpofu urged the doctors and nurses to provide the services regularly as the programme was benefiting vulnerable members of society such as the elderly and those from poor families who could not pay for such services. “The pills they gave me are going to last me three months and l believe this is the case for everyone else. We hope they will come back after three months,” said Mr Mpofu.
