The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter PREMIER Service Medical Aid Society (PSMAS) is effecting new subscription rates for adult dependants from February.
This comes after the Government scrapped coverage of adult dependants on PSMAS to lessen the financial burden on the medical aid scheme while ensuring the viability of the medical cover. It is from the Government’s decision that anyone wishing to cover an adult dependant will pay market rates for medical aid services and will not get a Government subsidy for the grown-up beneficiary.
In a statement, PSMAS said the new rates will be effected in February instead of January as previously announced to allow members to make appropriate decisions. <img class="alignnone wp-image-474832 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Public-Service-Commission-in-partnership-with-the-Office-of-the-President-and-Cabinet-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Public-Service-Commission-in-partnership-with-the-Office-of-the-President-and-Cabinet-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/Public-Service-Commission-in-partnership-with-the-Office-of-the-President-and-Cabinet-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “All biological children over 18 years with proof that they are still attending school under guardianship will continue to contribute the same subscription as the principal member,” reads the statement.
“Please note that monthly subscriptions for principal member, spouse and three biological children remain unchanged and subsidised by the employer.” The standard medical aid package for Public Service workers under PSMAS covers a member, spouse and eligible three children.
The Public Service Commission meets 80 percent while the employee pays 20 percent balance of the medical cover obligations.
Recently, Government said in the past few years, it noted with concern that civil servants have been facing challenges in accessing medical services.  The challenges relating to civil servants accessing medical aid are multi-faceted and these do not exclude abuse and fraud around access.
In view of the aspirations to have all public servants accessing medical coverage through PSMAS, the Government has made a decision that adult dependants shall not be subsidised by the subscriptions made by the Government for its public workers’ core beneficiaries. “The society wishes to advise its public sector members with adult or extra dependency to contact the society by 20 January 2023 to make necessary adjustments following the recent review of adults or extra dependants subscriptions,” said PSMAS. -@SikhulekelaniM1
