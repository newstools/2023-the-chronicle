The Chronicle Angela Sibanda, Showbiz Correspondent The use of digital platforms to promote one’s craft has always been emphasised by different individuals and organisations yet it remains an important subject considering the ever-evolving digital world. Without internet access which can be caused by the unavailability of networks or gadgets, it makes it impossible for anyone to understand digital skills and apply them. However, with the digital world taking over, artistes are left with no choice, but to try and catch up in order for them to make it. As part of the annual Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo, artistes converged at the National Art Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo last Friday for yet another workshop on digitalising art as well as earning something from their hard work. This was not the first time for artists to go through training and education on such, but those who attended the workshop described this edition as an enlightening and equipping meeting. <img class="alignnone wp-image-669376 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Phil-Chard-facilitating-the-workshop.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Phil-Chard-facilitating-the-workshop.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Phil-Chard-facilitating-the-workshop-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Phil Chard facilitating the workshop Facilitated by award-winning entrepreneur, content marketer and artist manager, Phil Chard from Harare, the workshop was attended by seasoned Bulawayo artistes and their managers. It was centred on artists being able to identify their target market, using relevant platforms for content promotion, being able to interact professionally with fans and followers, documenting their work and claiming ownership rights as well as running art businesses with the same mindset as that of other business people. Multi-award-winning Afro-pop musician Msiz’kay said the workshop will go down in the diary of 2022 as one of the few meaningful meetings. “As an artist, I’ve attended a lot of workshops and honestly, I didn’t learn anything literally from some of them, but this one has opened my eyes to things that I’ve been doing wrong or giving less attention to when it comes to my engagement on social media platforms. “I feel we could use more of such engagements,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-669379 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/intwasa-workshop-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/intwasa-workshop.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/intwasa-workshop-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Up-and-coming visual artist Shamiso commended the workshop facilitator, Phil for his inclusive engagement with all the participants adding that this made room for confident engagements. “The workshop was very eye-opening. I appreciate how Phil Chard gave us a very clear message during his presentation. He was attentive and positively responded to every question without making it look less important. “I also realised that as artists, we still have a lot of learning to do when it comes to the issues of applying for grants, owning our content as well as being aware of our rights and responsibility in the growth of the arts industry,” she said. Gugue, a Jazz Fusion singer and guitarist said the online revenue generation and the legal issues were an eye-opener for her. “I liked how Phil touched on the issue of revenue generation and how we can grow our brands on digital platforms. The subject of the legal aspects of music will go a long way in helping us avoid being exploited and exploiting others. “A key takeaway message from the workshop was that artists should maintain their dignity on social media by not commenting on issues that can tarnish their brands or which have nothing to do with their growth. They were also advised to turn their social media following into saved contacts and emails to establish reliable fan bases as this will likely increase their online viewership as well as attendance for physical shows,” Gugue said.
