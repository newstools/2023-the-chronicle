The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba and Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporters IT was a busy day yesterday in Bulawayo and Gweru as parents and guardians rushed to buy school uniforms and stationery ahead of schools’ first term opening next week Tuesday. While schools are set to open for the new term next Monday, some schools with O and A-level examination classes have already opened. Relieved parents said retailers have not yet raised the prices of school uniforms and other school items, as has been the norm in previous years. <img class="size-large wp-image-669760" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-26-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-26-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-26-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Back to school preparations begin They said prices vary depending on where one is buying.
However, they complained that uniforms and stationery are mostly sold in foreign currency, especially by small retailers and vendors. Big retailers such as Toppers Uniforms and Esats Stationery and School Wear are said to be accepting both foreign and local currency. Some people said they are forced to buy stationery and uniforms from pavement vendors because they have lower prices, compared to big retailers. While a school sun hat costs US$4 from the vendors, in big shops it costs US$6, a pair of school shoes cost US$15-US$18 at established retailers while from vendors they cost around US$10-US$12, and socks cost US$3 in retail outlets while vendors sell them for US$1. Vendors have stocked up and put on display both uniforms and stationery on the pavements.
Pirated textbooks, which have been banned at some schools, are selling for significantly less on the streets. Photocopied textbooks cost US$3 and original ones range from US$8-US$18. The news crew talked to people who were buying uniforms and books.
Mr Melusi Ndhlovu (53) from Luveve Suburb was buying uniforms for his last-born child going to Form One, at Toppers Uniforms. “I’m happy that I managed to buy uniforms for my son while prices were still low. This has helped me save some money for other school-related items that he will need because as you know children need a lot of items when they are about to open schools,” said Mr Ndhlovu. He encouraged parents to be wise by buying stationery and uniforms for their children while there is still time and when prices have not gone up, to save themselves finance-related headaches. Ms Ntombizodwa Muleya (38) from Hillside suburb said her son is going to a boarding school and all preparations had to be completed before the end of the week. <img class="size-large wp-image-669755" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-23-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-23-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-23-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Back to school preparations begin She said she compared prices from various retailers and bought what she could afford. “I came back yesterday from the rural areas for the festive season and I am happy that I found the prices of both the stationery and uniforms still stable. I know that there are high possibilities that after today prices are going to be raised due to high demand for school items,” said Ms Muleya. She said her main achievement of the day is being able to buy most of what her son needs for school.
Mrs Tholakele Moyo (40) from Mahatshula suburb said festive season spending has left her stranded as she still has to buy stationery and uniforms for her five children. She said she will first buy the most essential things that the children need and then buy the rest later when schools open.
“I overspent on the festive preparations and now I do not have enough money to buy everything for my children. Well, the good part is that my children are not attending boarding school so I will just have to buy a few items that they need now and I will buy the rest once their father sends money from South Africa,” said Mrs Moyo. She said buying uniforms yesterday seemed like last-minute buying as most retail outlets around the city centre were busy and crowded. Mrs Moyo said high demand resulted in parents failing to get the proper uniform sizes for their children.
Ms Lilian Siziba (30) from Pumula North suburb who was buying uniforms for her daughter in primary school at one of the vending bays in the city centre said: “I have been checking prices for uniforms and stationery around the city centre and observed that it would be much cheaper if I buy my daughter’s uniforms from the vendors. The stationery is also cheaper from these vendors.”  In Gweru, people buying school uniforms dominated shopping in the city centre.
Suppliers of school products have been recording brisk business. The first term usually attracts big business given that many pupils starting from Early Childhood Development (ECD), Grade One and Form Ones, will be going to school for the first time while other grades will be changing levels. Some parents said school authorities should not turn away pupils for non-payment of school fees considering the tough economic environment. The typical family with children in Grade 1 is shelling out roughly US$400 on school uniforms and other supplies.
For form 1 pupils, parents are spending at least US$600 on school uniforms and other supplies.
For private schools, the expenditure runs into more than US$1 000. A snap survey conducted by Chronicle revealed that business was at its peak at leading suppliers of school wear and small-scale stationery outlets. Vendors also took advantage of the surge in demand to make a killing by selling their wares on pavements.
There were long queues at outlets such as Enbee and on the pavements.
A street vendor Mr Maxwell Phiri said business was good at this time of the year. “We are always busy in January as parents prepare their children to go back to school. Parents compare our prices against those in leading shops and at times we offer an alternative and that is why we are still in business,” he said. Mr Phiri said they are also trying to capitalise on the demand for stationery by luring parents to the pavements.
“The challenge we face is the cat and mouse game with the city council and at times the police. But that doesn’t stop us,” he said. <img class="size-large wp-image-669748" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-19-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-19-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-19-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Back to school preparation Ms Terbeth Hove said most suppliers are accepting all forms of payment.
“I am buying school uniforms and supplies for my grade 3 son. He needed new shoes and stationery. You find these are all available in shops and on pavements with vendors and it’s a matter of choosing where to buy from and what currency to use,” she said. Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education communication and advocacy director, Mr Taungana Ndoro said it was illegal for schools to chase away pupils for non-payment of school fees. “The Secretary’s Circular Number 3 of 2019 dated 15 April 2019 clearly states on 5.3.1. that: ‘No school-aged child shall be denied a place at any registered school or turned away from school on the grounds of failure by the parents/guardians to pay fees and/or levies.’ It is therefore common cause that it is against Government policy not to send away any pupil due to non-payment of fees,” he said.
