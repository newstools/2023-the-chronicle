The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) three-day induction seminar taking place in Bulawayo is set to conclude today with a review of the strategic plan for the impending 2023 Castle Lager Premier League season.

“The idea to have all clubs represented in this meeting emanated from problems we had last year with the old clubs. We then decided that all clubs should send their leaders and administrators so that we induct them and we also get inducted because we made it interactive. “Whatever topic the facilitator will be interacting on, we also need input from the clubs. If you look at the strategic plan, it is not for the leaders but people who are going to use it and implement it, and those are the clubs,” said Jere.
He went on to give a hint on some of the subjects they have touched on before the conclusion of the meeting today.  “So far we have looked at the problems that we faced as PSL last season including fans not coming to the stadium, teams arriving at the stadium, and away teams is blocked. These are some of the challenges that we have discussed. “We looked at how these can be mitigated because we are topflight and we don’t want to see these things in our football.
“Clubs have been taught on organising the match day and how it’s done. We also need stakeholder mapping to look at who are the critical stakeholders in our football and how they should be treated. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-478817" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/psl-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/psl.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/psl-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Both the new and old teams are appreciating what we are doing here.
“Once we have reviewed and discussed the strategic plan with the clubs then we will be able to shed more light on the takeaways from the meeting,” said Jere. At their November meeting, PSL governors resolved to enforce club licencing this season.
They also made a resolution to have a club licencing committee after realising that most of the problems that football is facing stem from the failure to adhere to tenets of club licensing. The PSL committee will be visiting all 18 PSL clubs to see if they are compliant. Among issues that the committee will look into is to see if clubs have offices that are properly staffed, junior teams, and audited financials.— @innocentskizoe
