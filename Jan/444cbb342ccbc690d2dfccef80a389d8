In an interview yesterday, the Deputy Minister of Health and Child Care, Dr John Mangwiro said the Government has activated the process of replacing the damaged equipment with services expected to resume soon. “We are seized with addressing service delivery deficiencies at the Beitbridge District Hospital following the destruction of infrastructure and equipment, which resulted in disruption of theatre services when fire broke out on Monday,” said Dr Mangwiro. “So, our infrastructure development team is carrying out the necessary assessments which will then guide us on what needs to be done to resume services.” Dr Mangwiro said the hospital is a strategic health facility as it also caters for travellers passing through Beitbridge Border Post.   “We want to quickly restore normal medical services at the district hospital considering that it is strategically located. It serves the community in Beitbridge and surrounding areas including thousands of the regional and international travellers,” he said. In addition to being a district referral hospital for a population of about 30 000 residents, the 140-bed health facility also caters for the in-transit population passing through Beitbridge Border Post. An estimated 15 000 people pass through the border town daily, with figures increasing to more than 25 000 during peak periods. <img class="size-large wp-image-675190" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-23-at-14.14.18-2-680x365.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="365" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-23-at-14.14.18-2.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-23-at-14.14.18-2-360x193.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge hospital burnt Beitbridge District Hospital carries out an average of five small theatre operations a day, including around 30 Caesarian deliveries a month.
