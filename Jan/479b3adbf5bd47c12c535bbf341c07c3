The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief MR Xavier Matarutse of Mtapa suburb in Gweru is among residents now relying on water harvesting when it is raining because of Gweru City Council’s failure to provide water to residents. Many residents are going for weeks and in some cases months without running water as the council is failing to pump adequate water to meet the city’s daily consumption. Gweru residents are also facing a myriad of other challenges as a result of the council’s failure to provide services.
In the city centre, motorists are complaining that the city referred to as the “City of Progress” has just one functioning traffic light.  Driving along the city’s roads is a nightmare because of potholes which are damaging cars.
Residents of most western suburbs are also complaining of uncollected garbage and unattended burst sewer pipes. There is also the problem of flooding of houses due to uncleared storm drains in most suburbs
Local Government expert Dr Vincent Chakunda said urban planning was not keeping pace with population growth. “We have seen that provision of water and sanitation is not corresponding with urban growth. We have new settlements which is a confirmation of population growth but our supply dams remain Gwenhoro, Whitewaters and Amapongobwe, “said Dr Chakunda. He said potholed roads, overflowing sewage, improper solid waste management and failure to provide adequate water was evidence that council is failing to provide services to its residents. <img class="size-large wp-image-527624" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/gw-floods2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/gw-floods2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/gw-floods2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gweru residents carry their belongings from flood-hit homes recently Local Government expert Mrs Virginia Makanza said it is the mandate of council to ensure residents are provided with services such as provision of water and collection of refuse. “The issue of infrastructure decay shows lack of long-term planning,” said Mrs Makanza.
She said council, both urban and rual are supposed to represent and manage affairs of people in their respective areas. “The city fathers are expanding the city without a corresponding infrastructure development plan in the form of a new master plan. We have also seen legislative and implementation failures. The city has failed to explore other sources of revenue other than water and rates charges when it has been proved that these traditional methods are no longer sufficient,” said Mrs Makanza. She said there is also a need to attract new investors to expand the revenue base.
Mrs Makanza said residents on their part should strive to pay their bills to enable council to provide some of the services.
“Residents should also participate in council business. We had budget consultation meetings across the 18 Wards in Gweru but very few people attended. There is also political polarisation in council which affects service delivery,” said Mrs Makanza.
Renowned property developer Dr Tinashe Manzungu of TM group of companies said council has been lagging behind in developing supporting infrastructure in new settlements. Dr Manzungu said private land developers have played their role in the provision of houses which has helped council to reduce its housing backlog. Council spokesperson Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee said there is a need to expand water and sewer reticulation systems in tandem with increased population.
