The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HWANGE Football Club administrator Khumbulani Mbano says they are carrying on with normal preparations for the upcoming season despite their promotion still awaiting recognition from Zifa. Chipangano’s status as a Premier Soccer League team is still to be confirmed after it emerged that the Zifa Southern Region had not paid affiliation fees to the national association last year. Recently, the Southern Region pleaded with Zifa to recognise Hwange as the region’s champions while the issue of affiliation is being attended to. Hwange begin their preparations for the new season today with the squad set to assemble at the Colliery Stadium.
Mbano could not be drawn into giving out possible new faces at the club, choosing to comment once some of them have reported for training.  Hwange are said to be targeting players from Bulawayo City who were relegated from the PSL at the end of the 2021/22 season.
“We are hopeful that we will be playing in the topflight league. <img class="size-large wp-image-668762" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/uihj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/uihj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/uihj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange Football Club at the Colliery Our preparations will not be disturbed by the situation regarding our promotion.
“We are happy with the squad we had last season l am sure there will be a few additions but the decisions will be made by the coaches,” said Mbano. Chipangano will be looking to strengthen their squad as to survive longer in the PSL from where they were relegated at the end of the 2019 season. – @innocentskizoe
