The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE will host the Rugby Africa Olympics 2024 qualifiers set for September.
The pre-qualifiers will take place in Mauritius from June 24-25 before the action proceeds to Zimbabwe from September 16-17. The Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be the biggest event ever organised in France. The Olympic Games will take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024. Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) vice president in charge of sevens, Losson Mtongwiza said they are pleased to have been awarded the opportunity to host this competition. “We are excited about the opportunity to host such a prestigious competition. It’s a great honour. Having participated in Cape Town at the Rugby World Cup Sevens, this is another big step. I feel being given the right to host this competition is a recognition for the work we are doing in sevens rugby.  “The competition gives us an opportunity to improve our rankings as well. We will take the weekend of the tournament as an opportunity to host a number of courses to educate people on sevens’ rugby,” said Mtongwiza. Rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics was played for the first time at the 2016 Summer Olympics with both men’s and women’s contests. Rugby sevens was added to the Olympics following the decision of the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen in October 2009. The spectacle taking place during those weeks will go down in history and Paris will be the centre of the world, the world of sport and so much more. <img class="size-large wp-image-551940" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/UIKOF-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/UIKOF.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/UIKOF-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cheetahs line-up (file photo) The Cheetahs, as the Zimbabwe side is popularly known, will also participate in the 2023 Rugby Africa Men’s Sevens which will double as the qualifiers for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.
