The Chronicle   Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo province chairperson Joseph Nkomazana says the gap that has been left by the late Christine Sithole in the netball fraternity will be difficult to fill. Sithole died on New Year’s Eve after complaining of a headache. The 36-year-old was playing for Golden Girls in the Masiye Netball league. She was laid to rest in Chimanimani District on Tuesday. “It is with a heavy heart that we face the passing of Sithole. In this time of bereavement, our thoughts go out to the deceased’s families, friends and the entire netball community. She was a hard worker and someone who really had a love for the game of netball and contributed a lot to having the Masiye League at a level it is at today,” said Nkomazana. The main aim of the Masiye Netball social league is to promote and protect the girl child from the risk of HIV and AIDS, and drug abuse. Teams in the league include Jess Academy, Flying Eagles, Royal Montlers, Sizinda Queens, Mighty Queens, Swallows, Expandables, Seven Stars, Young Queens, Lobengula Leopards, East Rovers, Caaz and New Vision. – @innocentskizoe
