The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Pool Association (ZIPA) have been invited to take part in the 2023 All Africa Blackball Championships that will be played in Johannesburg, South Africa in October.

ZIPA public relations officer, Donald Wadawu confirmed that Zimbabwe will take part in the continental showpiece with their technical team headed by Wellington Chikasha still busy on number of teams and selection. Having participated in the four previous editions of the tournament, Wadawu said it is evident that the sport in the country is on the right track and are ready to fly the Zimbabwean flag high at the event.
“It shows that we are serious about building our sport and we are ready to put our country on the map,” said Wadawu.  The tournament will also give Zimbabwean players the much needed exposure through interacting with their counterparts from other countries.
As a member of the All Africa Pool Association, Zimbabwe will be permitted to enter a men’s and women’s team at the continental showdown. Each team shall be made up of a manager and five players. In the singles event of the tournament, a maximum of four additional players per category per member will be permitted to take part as the finest players from across the continent will take to the tables to battle it out.
Zimbabwe will have to pay a tournament fee of US$1 500 as all the other member countries. From the amount, US$500 will go towards affiliation fees and the rest will be used to cover the event. <img class="wp-image-605607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZIPA will therefore have to confirm their interest in participating on or before June 10 2023 and would be required to have paid the tournament fee. A champions league tournament is also scheduled for Mutare before the continental showdown, whose finalisation will be communicated in due course. — @brandon_malvin
