Mr. Roach is among the many investors that have commended the Government for creating an enabling environment for the establishment of new businesses by both local and foreign investors. Zimbabwe is in fact, now an investment destination of choice in the region and beyond as evidenced by the many new companies that are investing millions of dollars in the different sectors of the economy such as mining. Many lithium mining projects are taking shape across the country and very soon the country will be among the leading producers of lithium in the world at a time when lithium is the mineral of the moment due to the production of electric cars.  Lithium is used to manufacture rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, and digital cameras.
Late last year, President Mnangagwa presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for a new US$130 million Sabi Star Lithium Mine in Buhera district, Manicaland province which is expected to produce 300 000 tonnes of the mineral annually. The Sabi Star Lithium Mine is also expected to start production this year.
The other lithium mines are Bikita Minerals, Arcadia Lithium Mine, and Kamativi Lithium Mine. <img class="size-large wp-image-663961" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-7-copy-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-7-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-7-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Construction work has commenced at the Zulu Lithium project in Fort Rixon Many companies last year responded to Zimbabwe is Open for BusinZimbabwe’sand the trend is set to continue this year.
What is encouraging is that some of the new companies like Zulu Lithium Mine are employing skilled Zimbabweans in the diaspora, a confirmation that Zimbabwe has the required skilled manpower. Mr. Roach said Zulu Lithium Mine has engaged Zimbabwean artisans who are based in South Africa to undertake some of the construction works at the new mine. It is these skilled Zimbabweans in the diaspora that the Government is encouraging to return home and use their skills to exploit the country’s abundant resources for the development of the motherland.
