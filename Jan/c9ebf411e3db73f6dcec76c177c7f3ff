The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter CHURCH leaders have been challenged to preach peace ahead of this year’s harmonised elections. Speaking during the launch of the newly formed Pastors4ED Matabeleland North chapter in Kamativi early this week, Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Cde Richard Moyo, who is also Zanu-PF Matabeleland North provincial chairperson urged church leaders to mobilise people to vote peacefully in the upcoming elections. Zanu-PF is on a nationwide campaign targeting to raise 5 million votes for President Mnangagwa in the upcoming Presidential election. <img class="wp-image-653886 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-9-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-9-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-9-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs Minister Richard Moyo “Let’s work towards peacefully mobilising people so that we achieve our target of 5 million votes. As pastors, let’s not come and fish from the plate by mobilising members who are already in the church, let’s fish from outside as Jesus said go out there and become fishers of man,” said Cde Moyo who was represented by the party’s provincial commissar Cde Robson Ncube. He said Matabeleland North has a history of maintaining peace during election periods, and urged citizens to remain united and peaceful. Religious leaders in the province formed the provincial chapter of the Pastors4ED towards the end of last year with members drawn from different denominations in the province. Lupane based Pentecostal Church of God pastor Apostle Tamuka Nyoni is the interim Matabeleland North provincial coordinator while Kwekwe based Evangelist Idirashe Dondo who is also a councillor from Zibagwe Rural District Council in the Midlands is the founding national chairperson. The group aims to help inspire citizens to become patriotic citizens. Evangelist Dongo challenged pastors and other religious leaders to be innovative and embrace opportunities availed by Government. “We shouldn’t be pastors who are simply used as pawns or depend on donors, let’s be patriotic and be able to start projects and businesses. Some pastors appear to be poor because they want to wait for the church to take care of them yet we can lead our people into developmental projects. Today we are called to mobilise our congregants towards 5 million votes which is being targeted,” she said. Scores of people from Kamativi and Zanu-PF leaders from the province and Hwange district attended.  The party’s secretary for Transport and Welfare in the Hwange District Coordinating Committee Cde Sikhathele Moyo implored women and youths to embrace empowerment opportunities availed through the policy of devolution of power. “We thank President Mnangagwa for allowing this launch of pastors4ED which will not only help in the drive towards 5 million votes for the President for 2023, but also will open job opportunities for women and youth because a peaceful environment is conducive for investment and business,” said Cde Moyo. She commended the Pastors4ED for holding the event at Kamativi, a community that has been dormant since the closure of the tin mine more than two decades ago. “We want to thank churches for recognising Kamativi and today we have realised that pastors have a role to play in promoting peace and mobilising people to support Government and Zanu-PF in particular. If we are united like this, peace will prevail,” she added. The Pastors4ED platform is not an attempt to drag the church into politics but it is a strategy to make the church well informed about day-to-day events and to pray for the nation for development. This will also be a platform for churches to lobby stakeholders and authorities to address challenges faced by their members. Pastors4ED is also expected to play a leading role in maintaining peace within communities as the nation prepares for harmonised elections, and pray and encourage young people to emulate leaders and refrain from abusing drugs and substances.–@ncubeleon
