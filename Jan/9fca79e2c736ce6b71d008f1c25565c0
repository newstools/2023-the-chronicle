The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter ZIMBABWE’S gold deliveries to Fidelity Printers and Refiners increased by 19,3 percent to 35,3 tonnes in 2022 compared to 29,6 tonnes in the prior year as the country’s mining sector continues to boost output. Small to medium-scale miners continue to lead the pack in terms of production volumes after they delivered a cumulative 24,1 tonnes last year with large-scale miners delivering 11,2 tonnes.
The strong performance of the gold sub-sector indicates that it has the potential to meet the US$12 billion mining industry target by 2023. <img class="wp-image-583172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Under the US$12 billion mining roadmap, gold is expected to contribute US$4 billion, platinum US$3 billion while chrome, iron, steel diamonds, and coal will contribute US$1 billion.
Lithium is expected to contribute US$500 million while other minerals will contribute US$1,5 billion. The Government expects that by 2030, the mining industry will be generating upwards of US$20 billion.
According to statistics from Fidelity Printers and Refineries, November 2022 had the highest deliveries of 3,84 tonnes and December had the lowest at 1,98 tonnes.
October had 3,79 tonnes followed by September with 3,38 tonnes, August 3,35 tonnes, July 2,96 tonnes, June                    2,81 tonnes, May 2,99 tonnes, April 2,48 tonnes, March 2,56 tonnes, February 2,26 tonnes and January 2,87 tonnes.  Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF) chief executive officer, Mr Wellington Takavarasha, has said increased gold output was indicative of more collaboration and hard work by different stakeholders.
“Gold deliveries to Fidelity Printers and Refiners have greatly improved because of increased collaboration between stakeholders. These include the Chamber of Mines representing conglomerates and ZMF representing small-scale miners,” he said in a recent interview.
Mr Takavarasha said there have been several meetings and reviews of Government policies meant to boost production.
He said unlike in the past when the approach has been vindictive, the situation now was positive engagements between Government and miners. <img class="wp-image-582519 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-19-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-19-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-19-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Wellington Takavarasha “This has greatly improved the relationship between miners and state agencies,” said Mr Takavarasha.
He said Government has also come up with incentives for small-scale miners and this has boosted production.
“Last year there was US$10 million, which was set aside for small-scale miners and this helped to capacitate the miners and the availability of cash at Fidelity has also improved operations,” said Mr Takavarasha. — @SikhulekelaniM1
