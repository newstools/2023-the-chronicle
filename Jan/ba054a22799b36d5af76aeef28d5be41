The Chronicle Millicent Dube, Showbiz Reporter A new year comes with new resolutions and more opportunities that can bear fruitful outcomes and Afro-jazz sensation Thandy Dhlana cannot be more excited about the year ahead.  Since her appearance in the music industry, all she has done is serve her fans with classic music.
Commenting on the new year, the songstress said: “I’m really excited about the year 2023 as there’s a lot in store. There’s a new album on the way that’ll be released soon. We have dedicated a lot more to this new album and I can testify that it’s going to be amazing.” Her last album, Inganekwane was released in 2020 with the title track playing popular. Last year, she was nominated for the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) but unfortunately, luck was not on her side. However, she had her moment of grace in 2021 when she won the RoilBAA Best alternative music award. “Everyone deserves to shine. We all put the same energy and dedication into our work so we all rejoice when one of us wins and also celebrate each other’s losses,” said Dhlana. <img class="alignnone wp-image-487187 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Thandy-Dhlana.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Thandy-Dhlana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Thandy-Dhlana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thandy Dhlana The award-winning singer has been chosen to be part of The Bluffhill Jams production, a concept that features live studio music performances by various artistes.
