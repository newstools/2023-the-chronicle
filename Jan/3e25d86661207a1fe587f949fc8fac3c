The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief GOVERNMENT has come in to rehabilitate classroom blocks that were destroyed by a heavy storm at Mbaulo Primary School in Insiza as part of its infrastructure development drive. Two classroom blocks including an ECD block were damaged by rains early last year. Government provided the school with building materials to repair the ECD block last year. More resources have been delivered to the school to complete repairs. <img class="size-large wp-image-675598" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Building-material-arrives-at-Mbaulo-Primary-School3-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Building-material-arrives-at-Mbaulo-Primary-School3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Building-material-arrives-at-Mbaulo-Primary-School3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Building material arrives at Mbaulo Primary School Pupils from the school had to learn under a tree after their school was affected by rains. A parent, Mrs Lethokuhle Mguni said Government’s intervention has brought huge relief to the community. “We were really worried by the learning conditions which our children were now exposed to especially during the rainy season. When the classroom blocks were damaged last year our children who are in ECD were left without learning space. Government then intervened and provided us with resources to rehabilitate the ECD block. We are glad that Government has come in once again with more assistance to help the project,” she said.  Mbaulo Primary School Development Committee chairperson Mr Ronald Mpofu said the condition of their school has been a night mare for them. “It has been difficult to see our children learning under such conditions. When the school was damaged last year some of the classrooms were repaired but some were not. Some children had to learn under trees while others had to share the limited space which was available making it very difficult for children to learn properly and thereby disrupting lessons,” said Mr Mpofu. “Now that we have material we are going to put all hands on deck to ensure that we repair the remaining damaged parts timeously. We will work tirelessly to ensure that our children learn in a safe environment.” Chief Maduna from Insiza District commended Government under the Second Republic for prioritising infrastructure development and maintenance. He urged parents from the area to ensure that building material which the school has received does not lie idle but is put to use. Chief Maduna said the development of the school as well as the community was in the hands of community members. <img class="size-large wp-image-675597" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Building-material-arrives-at-Mbaulo-Primary-School1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Building-material-arrives-at-Mbaulo-Primary-School1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Building-material-arrives-at-Mbaulo-Primary-School1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Building material arrives at Mbaulo Primary School Insiza South legislator Cde Spare Sithole said Government is committed to transforming the education sector through creating a conducive environment for learning. He urged community members to augment Government efforts. “The children at this school were exposed to harsh learning conditions. I then engaged Government and managed to mobilise resource and the situation which was prevailing here was dire. Our President Dr ED Mnangagwa is passionate about education and that is why we are seeing such interventions. Government is committed to ensure that no place and no one is left behind in the development drive,” said the legislator. “Under the education sector we seek to address a number of outstanding issues. A number of schools have water challenges. Some of the infrastructure that we in the school is dilapidated. These are the discrepancies that we want to address. We want to also ensure that there is a decent accommodation for staff.” – @DubeMatutu
