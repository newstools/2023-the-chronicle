THE Zimbabwe Exiles Forum (ZEF) has commended the Government for setting plans in motion to assist Zimbabweans to have a seamless return home at the expiry of the Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP). The neighbouring country has been issuing special permits that allowed skilled Zimbabweans to legally work and live in South Africa and has extended them several times. An estimated 170 000 holders of the ZEP have until the end of June this year to migrate to mainstream permits in South Africa.  The last special permits were issued in 2017 and in November 2021. The South African Cabinet announced that no further concessions would be allowed on ZEP holders. The Department of Home Affairs granted a 12-month grace period up to the end of last month but later extended it to end of June this year. The returning residents have been given a special facility by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) to ship in all their property before the date of arrival in the country duty free. Zimbabwe Exiles Forum chairperson, Advocate Gabriel Shumba said the move by the Government was a step in the right direction. “We have been consistently working with individuals and formations that are affected by the pending repatriation of Zimbabweans from South Africa,” he said. “We are encouraged by the proactive role that the Consulate has taken in engaging Zimbabweans in South Africa, in particular, Mrs Melody Chaurura (the consul-general) and her team. <img class="wp-image-626347 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP) In addition, we also acknowledge the collaboration that the International Organisation Migration (IOM) has had with some organisations to alleviate the challenges on the ground”. Adv Shumba said there was also a need for the Government to educate the border authorities on the exact and proper procedures to clear the ZEP permit holders returning home. He said the duty free aspect was motivating although there was a need to have a total waiver on all properties for those returning home. The official said the issue of placement in schools for children of returnees coming from South Africa should also be looked into considering the education curricula in the two countries are different. “While we appreciate the relief given to Zimbabwean returnees in the form of priority clearance and some duty free concessions, we are receiving complaints that implementation remains a challenge for returnees,” said Adv Shumba. He said while applauding the concession on duty-free import, the worry was that they were being restricted to one car for people who have been in South Africa for 10 or more years.. <img class="alignnone wp-image-578680 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/IOM-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/IOM-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/IOM-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We would appreciate a blanket waiver on all properties for those returning,” said Adv Shumba. He said they had also received distress calls from the disabled community whom they believe should be prioritised when returning home. The Department of Immigration said recently that it is ready to assist Zimbabweans returning from the neighbouring country should they decide to do so at the expiry of the ZEP. The acting Head of Immigration at Beitbridge, Mr Trustworthy Manatsire said border workers will ensure a seamless clearance of the returnees. <img class="wp-image-669224 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/beitbridge-border-post-1.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/beitbridge-border-post-1.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/beitbridge-border-post-1-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge-border-post “We are ready to assist our brothers and sisters should they decide to come home at the expiry of the ZEP permits,” he said. “At the same time, we have advised our officers to provide adequate information to returning residents on the steps they need to follow when clearing themselves and their properties.” Mr Manatsire said Zimbabweans wishing to return home should contact any border official or the Zimbabwean Embassy in South Africa. Zimbabwe Ambassador to South Africa Mr David Hamadziripi said last week that they were conducting an audit to ascertain the number of Zimbabweans living in SA who are planning to return home ahead of the expiry of their permits. “We will be running a mapping exercise in all provinces,” he said. “We will be deploying our teams to central points across the country to engage with ZEP holders. “This will allow us to have an idea of how many are set to return and the kind of assistance they need.” — @tupeyo
