The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter SCHOOLS are expected to reopen for the First Term smoothly as Government and the civil servants continue to find each other in terms of welfare-related issues. In the past, it had become the norm for the reopening of schools to be characterised by teacher absenteeism as some of them said they were incapacitated to return to their workstations. This time around there is consensus between Government and teachers and as such teachers are all expected to report for duty on Monday. The teachers, like the rest of civil servants, received a Presidential bonus in addition to their usual 13th cheque and both were paid in foreign currency, a confirmation of Government’s commitment to improving the welfare of its workers. <img class="size-large wp-image-602851" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay Primary and Secondary Education Deputy Minister Edgar Moyo said the ministry has implemented necessary measures to ensure a seamless opening of schools. “In terms of our school calendar, we are ready for the opening of schools next week.

Deputy Minister Moyo said the ministry will also operationalise the Covid-19 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to guarantee safety of both pupils and staff. In an interview yesterday, Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima said the Government does not expect any disruptions when schools reopen on Monday. “All I can say is that there has been a commitment from the Government to improve conditions of service for all civil servants. The Government remains committed to addressing the employees’ welfare and this has been confirmed by the payment of the Presidential bonus inaddition to the usual 13th cheque,” he said.

Zimbabwe Teachers Association (Zimta) president Mr Richard Gundane said all educators are expected to report for duty on Monday. <img class="size-large wp-image-436468" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Zimta-president-Mr-Richard-Gundane-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Zimta-president-Mr-Richard-Gundane.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Zimta-president-Mr-Richard-Gundane-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimta president Mr Richard Gundane “Yes, we expect teachers to report for duty. However, we have noted that the Government did not conclude the negotiations during the holidays,” he said. “Teachers however expect Government to increase their salaries with effect from this month as prices of most commodities have gone up hence there are high expectations come pay day. Teachers love their job and want their pupils to pass but they need to be supported with an enabling environment.”  Mr Gundane also urged the Government to urgently address the issue of non-monetary benefits and to recruit more teachers as most schools are facing shortage of teachers resulting in big classes. “We raised the issue of shortage of teachers when schools closed last year. We need to recruit many teachers to addresss the shortage,” he said. Mr Gundane also urged the Government to timeously disburse school fees for pupils on BEAM.
Civil servants umbrella body, Apex council secretary general Mr David Dzatsunga said dialogue between the Government and its workers is critical to ensure an uninterrupted school term. “Social dialogue in an environment where we are trying to build consensus is important. There is a mutual appreciation of the circumstances that we are in and this is what is important for people to understand the operating environment,” he said. Mr Dzatsunga said in view of rising cost of living, they have requested for an urgent meeting with their employer to address welfare issues. “We have written to the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare requesting for an urgent meeting of the National Joint Negotiating Committee (NJNC). Some services have gone up and therefore, we need to meet and find the way forward,” he said. “Workers are aware that we have not had that dialogue for a long time hence the urgent need to meet with the employer.” -@nqotshili
