The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter LAST year, a new player in the entertainment circles descended on Bulawayo and brought joy to both the young and old with the introduction of the first inflatable Luna Park. After months of conquering the local scene, Nova Inflatables is ready to expand to other areas of Zimbabwe. <img class="size-large wp-image-670069" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-25-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-25-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-25-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Luna park The need to expand is a result of the huge response to the festive season demand after the company partnered with the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) for Christmas festivities in the park. The partnership saw the company setting up jumping castles, trampolines, water slides, inflatable pools, and electric and bumper cars among others at the central park.  Chronicle Showbiz visited the scene where the Luna Park was stationed over the festive period and was met with happiness on children’s faces. In an interview, Nova Inflatables spokesperson Progress Moyo said the 10-day partnership with the BCC was a success.
“Partnering with the city council was a success as people came in numbers to support with Christmas and New Year’s Days topping the attendance,” said Moyo. As the first company to offer bumper cars in Zimbabwe, Moyo said they are ready to pioneer innovative ways of having fun in the near future. <img class="size-large wp-image-670118" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-60-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-60.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-60-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nova Inflatables “Last year, we introduced new ways of having fun as the whole family. Moving forward, we plan to continue the trend and we’ll be introducing other things as the year progresses. We’ve covered ground, but we’re not entirely satisfied since we know our potential. “Areas that we have covered thus far include Hwange and Dete, but due to a huge demand in Gwanda, Beitbridge, Gweru, Harare, and Mutare, we hope to cover those places soon and give the people a Nova experience,” Moyo said. <img class="wp-image-670451 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tdsyfsdg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tdsyfsdg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tdsyfsdg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bumper cars offered by Nova Inflatables An amusement park, according to Moyo, is key as it promotes physical exercise for children in a rather stressed society where children and adults are often on their computers or phones. <img class="alignnone wp-image-670452 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/utsudfd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/utsudfd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/utsudfd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We endeavour to broaden our scope of business at the amusement park level where our services are at the client’s disposal at any time. Establishing this would help immensely to eradicate juvenile delinquency,” Moyo said. – @eMKlass_49
