The Harare charter was on Saturday also having a similar outreach. Beneficiaries have pleaded with the health ambassadors to offer such services regularly saying many of them could not afford to pay for health services or buy medicines. Mr Dingilizwe Nhliziyo from Cowdray Park pleaded with the health ambassadors to conduct monthly visits as people regularly get sick and have no money to visit the hospital. He said the workers were from the team were friendly to an extent that no one can say they are doing their work for free. “l am really happy l got free medicine for my legs. They have been giving me problems and l didn’t have money to go to the hospital. Now I am certain they will get better with the medication l was given,” said Mr Nhliziyo. Mrs Tarisai Tasiyana said by getting free medical services she was hopeful for improved health. She said she does not have money to regularly check her sugar levels and high blood pressure but was happy the health ambassadors did that for free. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-674903" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/HA-4ED-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/HA-4ED.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/HA-4ED-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “They should come more often so that we get frequent service because today my blood pressure was checked and l would like to check it again soon so that l can be able to monitor it,” said Mrs Tasiyana. Health Ambassadors 4ED acting Bulawayo chairperson, Ms Pamela Ndlovu, said the only challenge come across at the moment was lack of adequate medication to give to people. She said well-wishers who wish to donate can come forward and donate any medicine they have. “We are located at 14th and 15th Avenue along Jason Moyo at Ocean Bird offices. Those who are not free during the week to bring them can come through the outreach area we will be in,” said Ms Ndlovu. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-674898" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/hjsghdghd-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/hjsghdghd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/hjsghdghd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The donations will ensure that everyone who comes to our outreaches gets the medicine.” National vice president for Health Ambassador 4ED Mr Ganizani Phiri said they pride themselves in alleviating human suffering through free health services around Bulawayo.
