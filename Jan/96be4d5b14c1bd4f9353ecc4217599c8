The church’s arm from Magwegwe North Suburb had come to donate food, clothing and money to the home as well as hold a church service with the elderly inmates.

The service had to be moved to an open space within the premises. The inmates could not get enough of hymns 115 Inyanga Enkulu and 117 Ngiyeza Nkosi in the church’s Ndebele Hymnal which according to them, could have been sung the entire day if time would have allowed it. <img class="wp-image-677510 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-2-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-2-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-2-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Entembeni Old Peoples home receiving donations from SDA church (Great Hope) However, it was the theme song of the day 39 Dwala Eliqinileyo that appeared to attract residents in droves. Groups that include Golden Melodies, Steps to Christ and Spiritual Sounds added the renowned “SDA spice” with impeccable vocals.

The Adventures marched up front, followed by the Pathfinders, the youth and the women (Dorcas) brought up the rear. Residents lined up the street as the colourful parade made its way to the home. The service kicked off promptly at 10am. Church members prepared food for the elderly. After the service, Pastor Lunga and Supt Mpofu Masayi presented the donations. Supt Mpofu Masayi said the visit was primarily made to grant the elderly’s requests of missing being around people, especially their grandchildren, and children. “During the church’s visit to the home on Sundays where we clean and do laundry for the elderly, they made this request. As Great Hope, we selected Entembeni in Luveve because it is close to the church and we are not stopping there,” explained Mrs Mpofu. Entembeni Old People’s Home acting administrator Ms Celesani Tshuma thanked the church for the ‘uplifting donation.” <img class="wp-image-677514 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-4-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-4-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-4-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Great Hope Pathfinders follow proceedings during a church service at Entembeni old People’s Home “Please, always make time to visit our elderly and assist them.
