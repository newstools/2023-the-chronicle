Recruiting members means that the club will get some money. “Our wish is to see more chapters set across the city and we believe that this will also assist the club in communicating with their followers if they are in chapters. We believe in the power of numbers in that if the club needs help, we can assist where we can as a chapter.” Members of the interim Highlanders Cowdray Park Supporters’ chapter executive that is led by Dube include the vice-chairperson Precious Mathema, secretary Nqobile Ngulube, Charity Dube (treasurer) and committee member Trust Dube. -@ZililoR
