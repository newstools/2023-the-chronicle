In an interview yesterday, Prof Ncube said he was happy to be on the list of 100 most reputable Africans. “It is an honour to be included in the top 100 Reputable Persons in Africa for 2023,” said Prof Ncube. “This is an affirmation of the economic policies and the development direction that the country has pursued over the last 4,5 years since I became Minister of Finance and Economic Development. “The objectives and targets of the National Development Strategy 1, which are guiding the country’s trajectory, will surely deliver an upper middle-income, as envisioned in Vision 2030.” The Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa has embarked on a massive economic development trajectory aimed at improving the lives of people.  Ongoing infrastructure development works targeting construction of clinics, hospitals, schools, roads and bridges, shopping malls and border posts, have completely transformed the country in the last few years. From being a laughing stock in the Sadc region in 2017 to becoming a trendsetter, especially following the construction of the Beitbridge Border Post, which many Southern African region citizens are admiring. Construction of the Harare-Beitbridge highway, which had remained a pipe dream for a long time, is underway and 400km of the 571km have been completed and opened to traffic. The remaining 171km, which include bridges, are set to be completed in the first quarter of this year, in a clear demonstration of the efficiency of President Mnangagwa’s administration. Modernisation of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport is also underway as the Government moves to establish the country as a gateway to the continent and the world, benefiting from the rebound in tourism, as Covid-19 lockdown measures ease across the globe. <img class="size-large wp-image-626023" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-29-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-29.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-2-copy-29-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Completion of the project will increase passengers and cargo handling capacity at the RGM International Airport, ensuring it becomes one of the regional aviation hubs, attracting more airlines and facilitating tourist arrivals. Prof Ncube allocated $3,1 billion under the 2023 National Budget for the procurement and installation of air traffic control, surveillance, aircraft communication and weather equipment in order to improve air safety and security.
