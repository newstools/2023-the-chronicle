The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter IT seems not all is lost for Bulawayo Chiefs as a number of senior players from their Chibuku Super Cup winning squad participated in their first training session this week. Leading the players was captain Malvin Mkolo who has attracted interest from Simba Bhora and is also said to be wanted by Highlanders, a team that rejected him in 2015 when he tried his luck. <img class="size-large wp-image-648406" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Malvin-Mkolo-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Malvin-Mkolo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Malvin-Mkolo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Malvin Mkolo Mthokozisi Msebe, Obriel Chirinda, Felix Moyo and Ben Nyahunzwi are some of the players who were retained from last season. Newly appointed coach Lizwe Sweswe, who took charge of his first session on Monday, was happy with his take off.  “It is pleasing to see some of these senior guys here training which means we have a good base to start from. The presence of these players will help us build a team. Monday was our first meeting and we did introductions and laid out how l would like us to work. l was impressed with how the players recreated everything we did on the first day. Generally, l am happy,” said Sweswe. Chiefs are preparing to face four times in a row champions FC Platinum in the season opening Castle Challenge Cup next month. <img class="size-large wp-image-612727" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-19-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-42-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mthokozisi Msebe Both sides have resumed preparations for the new season but one thing for sure is that the defending league champions will be the better prepared. FC Platinum have also set their training base in Bulawayo and have been holding their training sessions at the ZITF grounds. The platinum miners who have since parted ways with William Stima, Blessing Moyo, Nigel Makumbe, Onifade Abubakar Temitope and Evidence Tendayi, have been fine tuning in Bulawayo. Pure Platinum Play have reunited with Perfect Chikwende who left financially troubled Amakhosi Amahle. — @innocentskizoe
