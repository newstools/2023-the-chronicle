“That team and its fans will forever hold a special place in my Heart. Grateful. I managed to do quite a lot of things including finishing my University studies because of Highlanders. Top Club,” he adds. Nyoni, making his first start since joining Highlanders during the mid-season transfer-window in 2013, scored his first goal for the Bulawayo giants in the 76th minute of a league game against Monomotapa at Emagumeni having come on as a substitute. Overwhelmed by emotions after scoring, the Highlanders striker made a high school celebration removing his shorts and running for at least 50m showing off his black and white boxer short which matched his jersey.  It was while at Highlanders that Nyoni graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce Honours degree in Marketing from the National University of Science and Technology. The forward left Highlanders to join Caps United in 2019 before moving to South Africa to sign for Maritzburg United. In Mzansi, Nyoni was haunted by injuries leading to him joining GladAfrica Championship side Cape Umoya. <img class="wp-image-605928 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nyoni graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce Honours degree in Marketing from the National University of Science and Technology.
