The Chronicle Angela Sibanda, Showbiz Correspondent Barely a few days into the new year and 2023 is already looking promising for the country’s poets. After S’phongo announced that he will be performing in Italy, France and Belgium, another poet, Obert Dube has also shared that he is set to grace one of the biggest festivals in Africa, the Sauti Za Busara Festival in Tanzania, next month. Dube said he has been invited to MC, perform as a poet and facilitate an artist workshop at the festival taking place in Zanzibar from February 10 to 12. The festival is an annual music event that showcases the diverse and dynamic line-up of exclusively African music and includes a carnival of street parades. It takes place in Stone Town in the Old Fort. Dube and Zimbabwean female Mbira artist Nasibo will be the only Zimbabwean artists on the Tanzanian-dominated line-up. Other countries to be represented during the highly anticipated annual event are South Africa, Egypt, Cote D’Ivoire, DRC, and Senegal.  Last year in August, Dube represented Zimbabwe at the International Afrika Expo Festival (IAEF) that took place in Tübingen, Germany. He also performed in other African countries including Botswana and Eswatini. <img class="alignnone wp-image-642800 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/hhhhhyy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/hhhhhyy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/hhhhhyy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obert Dube with Dr Susan Tatah, founder and presenter of Pan Afrikan Daily TV, the lady who invited him to the International Afrika Expo Festival in Germany The poet expressed excitement about this forthcoming gig saying he owes it all to God who continues to open avenues for him. He said getting recognition outside Zimbabwe is a sign that his brand has grown and become honourable enough to receive such recognition. “I’ve never performed at any festival here in Zimbabwe, but I’ve been getting invitations from outside the country. To me, this is an honour because it shows that my brand has matured and my work and talents are speaking for themselves. To have other countries consider me like this, I’ve no words to express how grateful I am,” said Dube. Based in Victoria Falls, the poet recently scooped the Outstanding Poet Award at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards, an addition to the collection of many other awards that he has received over the years.
