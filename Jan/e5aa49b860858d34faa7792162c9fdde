BULAWAYO-born Zimbabwe senior national team player Nicole Muzanenhamo says her focus is on playing at the 2023 Netball World Cup. The Gems are in Group A alongside Australia, Tonga and Fiji for the global showpiece that will take place in Cape Town, South Africa, from July 28 to August 6 this year. There are 16 teams participating at this Netball World Cup. Australia, who were runners-up to New Zealand at the last edition held in England, are the highest-ranked team in the world while Tonga are eighth and Fiji are 15th.  Muzanenhamo said she is looking forward to making the Zimbabwean squad as the country makes its second appearance at the Netball World Cup. “This year all the focus is on the World Cup. I am looking forward to that and l am hopeful that l will make the team. I have fused well into the national team and l am enjoying playing at the highest stage. “What is important for me now is to keep working hard. It’s a special feeling to play at such a stage. I recently took part in the Diamond challenge in South Africa and it was a learning curve for me and that will be important as we go into the World Cup preparations,” said Muzanenhamo. <img class="wp-image-662600 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Zimbabwe-Netball-Gems-in-South-Africa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Zimbabwe-Netball-Gems-in-South-Africa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Zimbabwe-Netball-Gems-in-South-Africa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Netball Gems At the age of 20, the Bulawayo star is the youngest player in the team.
