DRIVEN by the passion to promote potable and recyclable water solutions, a multiple award winning entrepreneur, Ms Cleopatra Ngwenya (32) has established a water engineering company, EcoVision. Ms Ngwenya said her sole aim is to provide sustainable water treatment solutions, which will help protect the health of Zimbabwean citizens as well as create a ground for a sustainable economy in the face of climate change.
EcoVision is a Bulawayo brainchild, which was registered as a legal entity in August 2019. The company has provided services for clients in the hotel industry, corporates, industry leaders, manufacturers, and individual households.  “Growing up I have always had an eye for business. However, starting EcoVision was different because it was driven by a passion for change in the water industry and the zeal to achieve 100 percent compliance for our potable water and recycled water,” said Ms Ngwenya. “Zimbabweans need clean water and that is what we want to provide. Our mandate is to engage all major service providers in the water industry to map a clear path for the provision of water in Zimbabwe.” “We are faced with an era of massive water rationing all around the country which as you may know is not just a Zimbabwean problem but a regional one since the Covid-19 pandemic. However as EcoVision, we are prepared to utilise our water treatment technologies to end any inconsistencies in water supply all around the country in line with the fulfillment of NDS1 and HE’s Vision 2030,” she said. <img class="size-large wp-image-606831" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-3-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-5-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZITF Ms Ngwenya has won many accolades in the business world, which include ZITF Best Mining and Engineering Exhibit 2022 – Silver, Megafest Silver Award Winner for Outstanding Woman in Engineering 2022, Zimbabwe CEOs Network Top Businesswoman of the Year Gold Winner 2022, and Middle East and Africa Markets’ Africa Excellence Award for Best Sustainable Water Management Services in Zimbabwe She was recently nominated by Zimbabwe CEOs Network for the Phenomenal Women’s Awards to be held in March this year.
She was also elected as Business Economic Empowerment Federation (B.E.E.F) Southern Region governor.
B.E.E.F is an organisation that seeks to promote the empowerment of the business community in Zimbabwe through advocacy for 80 percent of procurement to be done by local business people. “We believe that Zimbabwe can only be built by its own, and that as Zimbabwean business people, we should have the first right of refusal to any work that is meant to promote economic growth in Zimbabwe,” said Ms Ngwenya.
She also applauded the Government for its continued support to female-led businesses, saying that being in the business community is not easy for women as they have other duties to do outside business. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-412985" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/Zimbabwe-Women-Micro-Finance-Bank-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="322" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/Zimbabwe-Women-Micro-Finance-Bank-1.png 640w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/Zimbabwe-Women-Micro-Finance-Bank-1-360x181.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> “Being a woman in business has never been easy, chiefly because generally, a woman has many other responsibilities outside of being a business person,” she said. “When I initially started EcoVision, there were a number of challenges however with the Government of Zimbabwe availing equal opportunities to all Zimbabweans, as well as promoting women empowerment, doing business in Zimbabwe as a woman is slowly becoming smooth.” When Zimbabwe celebrates its 43rd Independence Anniversary on April 18, one of the achievements to look back to with pride is the significant milestones the country has recorded in its quest to empower women. To support female-led businesses, the Government has introduced many platforms, which are meant to provide easy access to finance and these include the Women Micro-Finance Bank among others.
