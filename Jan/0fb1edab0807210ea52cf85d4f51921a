The Chronicle   Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter AFTER a robust digital skills learning workshop last week at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, local creatives will soon reap rewards as social media marketing hub Ampstreet has launched an AU Legacy Program. The AU Legacy Program is a combined effort by representatives of Ampstreet in Zimbabwe and Australia to merge up-and-coming artistes from Australia and Zimbabwe who have signed up for the programme to collaborate. The program will be all year round and will see an Aussie-Zimbo connection through collaborations and the sharing of ideas on how to monetise artistic craft between Zimbabwe and Australian artistes. Ampstreet, based in Zimbabwe and Australia has acted as the bridge connecting local acts with international ones. Ampstreet’s founder and chief operating officer Arthur Mumba pointed out the need for creatives to have a strong digital footprint. “We understand the importance of a brand’s social media presence. We empower great ideas and believe that great content comes from great people and that is why we have launched such a platform to help local creatives reach their full potential. Many times, creatives have great content but lack the requisite skills to package it for their audience and it is our aim to connect local acts to those in Australia. Having a robust online presence is a standard nowadays as music has to be accessed globally,” he said. <img class="wp-image-595087 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Arthur-Mumba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Arthur-Mumba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Arthur-Mumba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Arthur Mumba Ampstreet has served as a launchpad for up-and-coming artistes by giving them exposure to relevant spaces. The agency is widely known for creating Electronic Press Kits (EPKs) which are CVs for artistes and these help them in media spaces with essential information to understand who they are and what are their plans going forward. – @eMKlass_49
