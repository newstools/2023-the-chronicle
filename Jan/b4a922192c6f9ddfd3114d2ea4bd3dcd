The Chronicle   Mthabisi Tshuma, Online Reporter POET Dr Gasolo is planning to host his 190km walkathon again this year after his first one last year. The walkathon was launched in September last year as a bid for the nation at large to rally behind and financially support local artistes. Quizzed if the debut walk had fruitful results, Dr Gasolo said: “I must say it was fruitful. I managed to make a name for myself, especially in Matabeleland South. Now, almost everyone knows about me and the reason for the walk. “I also met a businesswoman who runs The Valley Bar, located about 15km out of Bulawayo) who was blown away by the idea of the walk and pledged to partner with me and other artistes in our works so that we grow.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-669724 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/xgfsfhg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/xgfsfhg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/xgfsfhg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The walk is once again expected to start from Dr Gasolo’s rural home in Matshetsheni to Bulawayo via Gwanda town on August 10. Along the way, Dr Gasolo will stop in Gwanda and Esigodini. Dr Gasolo said for the second walk, he has decided to properly plan so that more artistes are incorporated and recognised. “The first time I had great plans, but I didn’t manage to do everything as planned. This year, I’ve decided to start preparing early so that I put everything in place single-handedly as some people who made pledges last year, didn’t fulfill their promises. “For this year, I’m planning to have a party in Matshetsheni before leaving. There’s a lot of talent there and there are artistes that I’m helping the artistes to polish their craft. These are the people who’ll be performing at the party. “The biggest event will be in Bulawayo where I’m planning to host my first live poetry DVD recording upon arrival in the city on 12 August,” said Dr Gasolo. – @mthabisi_mthire
