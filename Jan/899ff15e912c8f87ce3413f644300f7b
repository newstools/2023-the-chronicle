The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau BEITBRIDGE residents have implored investors to consider setting up rehabilitation facilities to cater for people who are addicted to drugs and substance abuse. Presently, Beitbridge has no facilities to handle such people with most of the drug abusers being taken to other places such as Harare and Bulawayo for assistance. The most commonly abused drugs in Beitbridge are crystal meth, droshky, cocaine, glue, broncleer and embalming powder.
Some common serious mental disorders associated with chronic drug abuse include; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, manic depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), generalised anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder among others. <img class="size-large wp-image-579621" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/DRUGSDD-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/DRUGSDD.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/DRUGSDD-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> substance abuse Beitbridge East MP, Cde Albert Nguluvhe said the rampant cases of drug peddling in the border town is worrying.
He said he has since engaged the police and other community leaders so that they can work together to fight the scourge. “The level of crime, especially domestic violence and the abuse of drugs, is a cause for concern. Reducing such activities in the town requires local leaders to work with other stakeholders to address the problem,” he said. Cde Nguluvhe said he had a meeting with police and community leaders who all agreed that apart from fighting this scourge of drugs peddling and abuse, there is a need to also encourage investors to set up at least one rehabilitation centre in the border town. He said the facility will cater for people who are already affected and addicted to the use of drugs.
Cde Nguluvhe said some family members continue to incur huge losses by taking their relatives to rehabilitation centres in other towns. He said as a way of fighting drug peddling and abuse those with information should share with authorities so that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to book.  Last December police arrested Beitbridge woman, Gladys Mashudu Moyo (33) on allegations of selling drugs around the Lutumba area. Moyo of Mapolovele Village was arrested following a tip off. She has since been charged for violating sections of the Dangerous Drugs Act. Moyo was found with 23 sachets of crystal meth and 40 sachets of dagga.
Beitbridge Mayor, Councillor Munyaradzi Chitsunge said it is critical for the corporates to join in the fight against drug peddling.
“There is more we could do together, let’s pool resources and build a rehabilitation centre for the drug addicts while other systems are being put in place to eradicate this vice. It is quite disheartening to see the rate at which our youths are getting hooked to these dangerous substances,” he said. Mrs Babongile Gora who operates a facility that assists victims of gender-based and domestic violence said on a daily basis they handle people seeking counselling on drug related issues. District Medical Officer, Dr Lenos Samhere said although it is difficult to come up with exact figures of drug addicts, the medical facility continues to handle a significant number of patients. “We are attending mostly to those being brought to us by their relatives. Some victims are not willing to come to the hospital to seek help on their own,” he said. “Ideally, we need a rehabilitation facility so that such people can be assisted by professionals.”
Matabeleland South province has since formed a taskforce to address the problem of drugs abuse, which is rampant especially in mining and border towns. President Mnangagwa, on National Youth Day last year, declared war against the menace. He also announced the setting up of a fund to fight drug abuse.–@tupeyo
