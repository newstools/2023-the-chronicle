The Chronicle PEOPLE need to know that negative emotions can become an idol. You can idolise them until they become a god. Do not give place to the devil by appreciating and holding on to negative emotions. Do you know that there are some people who love worry to an extent that worry has become a god in their lives. They can not live without worrying. Some have stress, grief, and depression. If there is no problem in their life they will persistently look for one and then focus intently on it. Some people turn to alcohol to try to fight stress and they become addicted. They worry before they go to bed and worry when they wake up; they even worry when they are on WhatsApp!
Everything about certain people is about worry. They worry about tomorrow, about their past, about who they will marry, about how they are going to live with that man, they just love to worry about everything. They worry about how their face looks, their hairstyle, and even their death which is not yet there! Who will come to my funeral, will people gather, will there be a convoy, where will I be buried?  People can even envision themselves in a coffin and begin to allow self-pity to envelop them, maybe even shed a tear or two. It is a foul spirit of the devil! When it reaches this extent it has become an idol in your life; a god which you are worshiping, which no one can deliver you from. I teach about forgiveness but some people will not forgive because their unforgiveness is now right in their eyes; they love and worship it. <img class="size-large wp-image-603235" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible- Image taken from Shutterstock If you are the one who is wounded, let that person go forgive. If you release people it sets you free from retaining their sins.
Do you know that there are people with a problem in that no matter how positively you speak to them and into their lives, they will always be negative? They will come and tell you, “Prophet, things are not moving in my life, things are hard.” Even if such people get a Million Dollars, because to them nothing moves, even if they become a billionaire they will say nothing moves. They will remain miserable. Do you know that there are people who are never content with their lives or with any progress?
God Bless.
