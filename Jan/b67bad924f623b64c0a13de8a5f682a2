SIERRA Leone-based poet, S’phongo (real name Tennson Ncube) has kicked off the new year on a high note as he is billed to perform in Italy, France and Belgium, starting today. The versatile artiste who hails from Matobo will start his tour with a poetry and DJ set at Magazzino Parallelo in Cesena, Italy today before travelling to France for a poetry performance at Paris Lit Up tomorrow. Next Monday, he will head to Brussels, Belgium to give art lovers there a feel of his art. In an interview, an excited S’phongo said he worked tirelessly to clinch the career-changing gigs.  “After my first show in Italy last year, they invited me again, not only to perform poetry but to also do a DJ set, a skill that I consider a hobby. As for Paris Lit Up, I reached out to them via email, and a few days later, I got a response from ED Bell, the president expressing his interest in my art and offering me a featured performance at their weekly open mic in Paris. “For the Belgium gig, I met one of the organisers, Vera Cavalin in Sierra Leone early last year and she fell in love with my art. We started arranging how I could share it with SMOG and fast-forward to 2023, I will be on their stage on the 9th of January,” said S’phongo. <img class="alignnone wp-image-488757 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/poetry11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/poetry11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/poetry11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said he is geared up for a fruitful year filled with success and growth. “Last year I got to share my work with a French audience in Ivory Coast, performed in Italy, and won three slams from three countries. 2022 was an eventful year for me as I also published my debut book. In 2023, we’re dreaming bigger and acting more because, without action, we remain stagnant. As such, in 2023, I’ll be publishing my second book which could be titled ‘No! I won’t turn off my mind’,” said S’phongo while paying homage to his editor, Philani Nyoni.  The spoken word artist has been instrumental in telling the African story through his poetry shows and open mics that he has been hosting in Sierra Leone. – @mthabisi_mthire
