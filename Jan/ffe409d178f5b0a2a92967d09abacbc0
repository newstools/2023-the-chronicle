PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday joined the Maketo family in mourning the death of Air Commodore Pio Pasipamire Maketo who died in a road accident on Saturday last week and was buried at Gweru Provincial Heroes Acre yesterday. President Mnangagwa conferred Air Commodore Maketo (55) Liberation War Heroes status.  Air Commodore Maketo, who was Jason Ziyaphapha Moyo Base Commander, died in a road accident along the Harare-Bulawayo highway, 10km from Chegutu. In a statement, President Mnangagwa said the country has been robbed of an exceptional trainer and dedicated cadre of the ZDF following the death of Air Commodore Maketo. “The demise in a fatal traffic accident last Saturday of Air Commodore Pio Pasipamire Maketo has robbed our Air Force of Zimbabwe of an exceptional trainer and dedicated cadre of our Zimbabwe Defence Forces,” he said. Cut at the prime of his career, President Mnangagwa said, Air Commodore Maketo leaves behind a meritorious career that include several peace-making missions in the region. The President said the late air commodore trained countless airmen and women after qualifying as a flying instructor in the late 1980s. <img class="wp-image-672807 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Air-Commodore-Pio-Maketos-widow-Grater-Mabodza-receives-the-national-flag-from-director-Mr-Kudakwashe-Machako1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Air-Commodore-Pio-Maketos-widow-Grater-Mabodza-receives-the-national-flag-from-director-Mr-Kudakwashe-Machako1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Air-Commodore-Pio-Maketos-widow-Grater-Mabodza-receives-the-national-flag-from-director-Mr-Kudakwashe-Machako1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Air Commodore Pio Maketo’s widow Grater Mabodza receives the national flag from director Mr Kudakwashe Machako “Amidst countless challenges placed in the way to frustrate our bid to Africanise the nascent Air Force of Zimbabwe soon after independence, and the subsequent integration of hitherto warring armies into a new National Army, cadres like late Air Commodore Maketo had to be redeployed from the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), to the Air Force of Zimbabwe in order to transform that key arm of our Zimbabwe Defence Forces so it reflected the new, multiracial post- independence ethos of a free Zimbabwe,” he said. President Mnangagwa said alongside his peers, Air Commodore Maketo hastened the realisation of this key cog in the broader vision of the ZDF. He said before long, the late Air Commodore would be involved in the Mozambican Campaign meant to secure the country’s routes to the sea and to support Mozambique, then under attack from apartheid-sponsored bandits. Later, President Mnangagwa said Air Commodore Maketo was involved in supporting operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). <img class="wp-image-671915 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa “Our Nation will forever remember him and his generation of airmen for their salutary contribution to our Nation and for building peace in our region. On behalf of our Nation, Government, ZDF, my family and  my own behalf, I wish to express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the Maketo family, his wife Grater, and the four children, who have lost a loving husband and caring father respectively. As they grieve over this their saddest loss, may they find solace in that our Nation comforts them, and will forever remember the sterling contributions of the late dear departed Air Commodore,” said President Mnangagwa. Meanwhile, people of all walks of life thronged Gweru Provincial Heroes Acre to pay their last respects to the late Air Commodore.
