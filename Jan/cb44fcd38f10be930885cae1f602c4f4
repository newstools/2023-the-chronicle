TURKISH Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Mevlut Cavusoglu is expected in Zimbabwe to hold talks with Acting President Dr Constantino Chiwenga as bilateral ties between the two nations strengthen. This will be the first time that a high-level Turkish Minister makes a visit to Zimbabwe, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade spokesperson Mr Livit Mugejo. This visit comes at the back of Zimbabwe and Turkey last year celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations with the countries emphasising that all the necessary conditions have been created for expanding and deepening productive cooperation between the two nations.  Last year, Turkish Ambassador to Zimbabwe Berna Kasnakli Versteden said Zimbabwe and Turkey must broaden economic and trade cooperation to complement existing strong political relations between Harare and Ankara. Mr Mugejo said Minister Cavusoglu is expected to hold talks from January 10 and 11 with Acting President Chiwenga and Minister of Foreign Affairs Professor Fredrick Shava. “The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, Honourable Mevlut Cavusoglu, will be visiting Zimbabwe from 10 to 11 January 2023. <img class="wp-image-558420 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/fgdh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/fgdh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/fgdh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZimStat external trade graph “He is scheduled to hold talks with Acting President Honourable Dr Constantino Chiwenga and his counterpart, Honourable FM Shava,” said Mr Mugejo.
