The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter FARMERS stand a chance to reap big earnings through earthworm cultivation known as vermiculture, which is gaining momentum in the fisheries value chain and is recommended for promoting sustainable cropping as it improves soil fertility. Experts say earthworm growers can earn more money by selling earthworms for vermicompost and the trade can be done by smallholder farmers for use as fertiliser or as feed for those into fish farming. Vermicompost is a process whereby earthworms turn organic debris into worm castings, the fertile waste from earthworms. By doing so, farmers who are into organic farming can use vermicompost in their fields while earthworms can be used as feed in fish farming. In an interview, agronomist consultant, Mr Leo Maphosa who is founder of CropTech Systems, said vermiculture provides mechanisms that improve smallholder farmers’ livelihoods in Zimbabwe based on its sustainable practices.  “Earthworms or vermicompost are proving to have increased productivity and enhanced profitability due to its low cost,” said Mr Maphosa. “With the growing use of vermicompost, the nutrient density is increased especially where we have poor soils and the structure and health of your soil also improves.” He said an average of four and five farmers can use vermicompost as a foliar spray in soils that are poor and also use compost material to retain moisture, which is also important in plant growth. “Trials are proving that vermicompost soup is acting to attract beneficial organisms to the plant surroundings and reducing the need for pesticides and fertilisers,” he said. “The rise in the cost of producing food has no other alternative than to scale up the use of organic mechanisms to address the dire capacity in food systems as the land is depleted from use of synthetic fertilisers and chemicals. “Vermicompost is eco-friendly and helps in building the soils and sustaining food safety measures towards a green world.” Environmentalists believe going green in agriculture is the most effective way to preserve what is left of the environment, which has always been the main source of food production for people and wildlife. This could be achieved through utilising eco-friendly materials when conducting agriculture, which comprises farming, livestock keeping, and gardening. <img class="wp-image-613923 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-39.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-39.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-39-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Organic fertilisers In green farming, organic inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, fungicides, and pest controls made from natural components are used. Environmentally friendly tools are used as well. These aid in avoiding harm to the environment and nurturing wildlife. Another headache for Zimbabwe is the declining level of maize productivity despite a huge investment in fertilisers. According to a 2020 Food and Agriculture Organisation report, there is a marked decline in maize production while the amount of chemical fertilisers used increases. In 2004, maize production stood at nearly 2,4 million tonnes with close to 18 000 tonnes of fertiliser used while by 2018, Zimbabwe only produced 730 000 tonnes of maize from around 92 000 tonnes of fertiliser used. – @SikhulekelaniM1.
