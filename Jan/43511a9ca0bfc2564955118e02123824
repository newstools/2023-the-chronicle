The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter AFTER several years of working as a radio technician and satellite dish installer, Mr Obert Murimbika ditched the trade and joined the solar energy sector back in 2006. At the time, there were not many solar system installers on the market.
However, in recent years, Mr Murimbika reckons that the sector has been ‘‘invaded’’ by chancers. “Solar energy is a gold mine right now. It’s a boom, a bonanza,” he says with a chuckle.
“It reminds me of the days when wiztech satellite dish installation was popular. Everyone who thought of making quick money reinvented themselves overnight to make a living from satellite dish installation. The same is happening now with the solar business.” Many Zimbabwean businesses are turning to solar energy due to Zesa’s long hours of load shedding.
Captains of industry say the power shortages that the country and the region are facing should be seen as a reality check for businesses and households to start investing in solar energy as a long-term solution. It has been argued that Zimbabwe has a strong case for adopting solar power since it experiences long hours of sunshine throughout the year with Government encouraging industries to build solar plants.  Solar panels have become part of the landscape in residential areas and business premises.
Mr Murimbika acknowledges that the installation business is booming but is quick to warn of the salient dangers. He explains that some clients are caught in the craze and end up buying wrong panels and inverters.
Mr Murimbika said it is unfortunate that at times the quality of products is a secondary consideration hence the solar system’s lifespan is not given much thought. He said as such many people are being sold fake products that have flooded the market.
A basic solar system includes a solar panel, battery, an inverter and a controller. The lifespan of a panel is from five years for the cheapest to over 25 years for premium quality according to Mr Murimbika.
“Installers are in high demand. Sometimes I tend to think that people are installing solar systems for prestige as it’s now fashionable,” he says. Mr Murimbika said many people rush to have the solar system installed but they do not have the knowlege on the quality of products that are required. Social media is awash with companies selling an assortment of gadgets, including sub-standard products, a development that worries the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority. <img class="size-large wp-image-665842" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/fbzdzbndg-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/fbzdzbndg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/fbzdzbndg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Harnessing solar energy People with lower budgets end up with the worst systems, says Mr Murimbika.
“They’re buying what they consider to be cheap yet they are fake products that do not last,’’ he said. Zera chief executive officer, Mr Eddington Mazambani said an increasing number of households are using solar power but the regulatory authority does not have ready national statistics. “The authority is mandated to promote renewable energy and as such is actively promoting the use of solar energy. The use of solar power has increased over the years as evidenced by the sprouting number of retailers and service providers,” said Mr Mazambani. He however, said although Zera has developed standards for all solar products and also drafted regulations for checking the quality and standards of the products, sub-standard products are flooding the market. Zera therefore continues to receive complaints of poor service provision from consumers of solar power.
“Legislative changes to relevant legal acts are being made to pave the way for promulgation of the regulations. The Authority has set aside a budget for testing equipment to enhance the quality compliance enforcement in the renewable energy sector. Gadgets on the market are also subjected to the Consignment Based Conformity Assessment (CBCA) programme where the products are issued with conformity certificates at source” said Mr Mazambani. He said sub-standard products are flooding the market because of unscrupulous dealers and porous borders.
Zimra has therefore been engaged to intensify product checks at port of entry. Renewable energy service providers are assessed by Zera and there is a list of recommended providers.
According to research, by August last year, there were 159 registered solar equipment service suppliers and 11 were in Bulawayo. Miss Carol Ndimande, a solar systems trader operating from the Bulawayo city centre said counterfeits are likely to pose environmental challenges. <img class="size-large wp-image-528767" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/solatr-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/solatr.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/solatr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some of the houses in Bulawayo where solar power has been installed Battery life spans vary depending on type, from a few months for some gel batteries to 10 years for lithium batteries.
She notes that the expiry of batteries might translate to a solar waste glut if not disposed of properly. “I’m now noticing panels dumped in open spaces in residential areas and children even playing with the discarded panels. Used appliances are randomly disposed of and this is likely to damage the environment,” she said. Miss Ndimande appealed to the community to familiarise themselves with various solar system components before buying.
“Overnight traders are selling solar panels that are inscribed 300 Watts but they only generate 150 Watts or even far less.”
According to Miss Ndimande, a 300 Watt solar panel, 12 volts battery, a regulator, 1 000-Watt controller and 30Amp controller can power several household gadgets. While interviewing Miss Ndimande, three clients in a hurry bought different solar system appliances.
They did not seem eager to engage Miss Ndimande on guarantees and quality of the products. This is probably why many people are buying solar appliances they do not fully understand how they work.
According to Zera, when buying solar PV equipment, it is important to calculate the total power and energy consumption of all loads that need to be supplied by the solar PV system. An inverter is used in the system where AC power output is needed.
“The input rating of the inverter should never be lower than the total wattage of appliances. The inverter must have the same nominal voltage as your battery. For stand-alone systems, the inverter must be large enough to handle the total amount of Watts you will be using at one time. In addition, the inverter size should be 25 to 30 percent bigger than the total Watts of appliances.” For grid tie systems or grid connected systems, the input rating of the inverter should be the same as the PV array rating to allow for safe and efficient operation. The battery type recommended for use in solar PV systems is a deep cycle battery. “Deep cycle batteries are specifically designed to be discharged to low energy levels and rapidly recharged or cycle charged and discharged day after day for years. The battery should be large enough to store sufficient energy to operate the appliances at night and during cloudy days.”
