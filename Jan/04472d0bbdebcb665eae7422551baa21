The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief THE Ministry of Local Government and Public Works has approved the 2023 budgets for Gweru and Masvingo City Councils, among other local authorities. The City of Gweru submitted a US$37 million budget or equivalent in local currency at the inter-bank exchange rate while Masvingo City tabled a US$23, 6 million budget. Gweru and Masvingo were part of the 92 local authorities that recently presented their 2023 proposed budget before the Minister of Local Government and Public Works, July Moyo. The minister and his senior staff undertook a rigorous process of budget analysis leading to the final approval. The process took almost a week including weekends, from January 3 to 10 this year. Gweru’s finance team came up with a budget proposal that went through the council management and finance committee. The local authority then engaged various stakeholders among them the business community, residents, informal traders, non-Governmental organisations, civic society, and churches. Last year’s budget for Gweru was pegged at $4,9 billion. The city’s public relations officer, Ms Vimbai Chingwaramuse, confirmed the budget approval. <img class="wp-image-629500 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Vimbai Chingwaramuse “The Ministry of Local Government and Public Works has approved our 2023 budget of US$37 million,” she said.

A total of US$70 000 has been budgeted for purchasing equipment for the maternity wing at the recently opened North West Medical Clinic in Runyararo West. Minister Moyo has said the budget approval process had afforded a one-to-one interaction between local authorities, the ministry, and other Government agents. He said councils have been able to explain in detail all the projects they undertook in 2022 and provided pictures of the projects accomplished. Money for the projects came mainly from devolution funds while some councils used their own funds to complement the Government. Ratepayers have been encouraged to consciously support their councils to ensure rapid development ahead of the attainment of Vision 2030 of an empowered upper-middle society.
