The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Andrew Tapela-led Zifa Southern Region executive insists they are still the legitimate authority in the region despite being chucked out by clubs at a meeting held at the regional offices on December 19. At the meeting, clubs decided against renewing the mandate of three executive committee members, chairman Tapela, his deputy Gaylord Madhunguza as well as secretary Mehluli Thebe which ended in October. The majority of the clubs, 12 out of the 17 who attended the meeting, agreed to boot out Tapela, Madhunguza, and Thebe. Board member finance Tizirayi Luphahla survived the axe. Before passing a vote of no confidence on the trio, the clubs co-opted seasoned administrator Lloyd Munhanga of Zimbabwe Saints and Mosi Rovers’ representative Tafadzwa Mutowa into the board. Munhanga and Mutowa were filling the gaps left by Bryton Malandule who was elevated to the Zifa national executive before he was ousted, as well as Fiso Siziba who assumed the vice-chairmanship role at Highlanders. <img class="size-large wp-image-420275" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/southern-region-team-680x366.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="366" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/southern-region-team.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/southern-region-team-360x194.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> (From right to left) New Zifa Southern Region chairman Andrew Tapela with his team, Gaylord Madhunguza, Mehluli Thebe, Fiso Siziba and Tizirayi Luphahla (Pic: Thandazani Zimbwa) The ousted executive has maintained their silence until now when they have released their response in writing.
“The executive committee wants to reiterate the position that it is still the legitimate authority of the Southern Region. Any attempts to oust it through unconstitutional means will be regarded as null and void.  “Many attempts to destabilise the Regional League have been made from the day the members were voted into office until today,” wrote the Tapela led executive. They said their insistence on staying in power is not out of greed but need to have the constitution followed.
“Some members have refused to accept the outcome of the 2018 Southern Region elections hence the spurious and endless accusations. “To all progressive and peace loving football stakeholders. It is not the Executive Committee’s intention to cling to office. Certainly not, especially under this toxic environment. “We do not belong to anyone, we support no one but constitutionality. All that we pray for is that utmost respect must be given to constitutional processes and that they must be followed to the letter no matter how much one dislikes the incumbent,” the statement further read. <img class="size-large wp-image-666186" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-6-13-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-6-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-6-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andrew Tapela In the same statement, the executive discredited the meeting by the clubs.
“What they did was simply to convene a social gathering after fifteen days of what they deemed was a notice of an EGM. Consequently, any decisions arrived at that gathering composed of both relegated teams and non-fully affiliated teams were null and void and of no force. “The Southern Region Executive committee still remains the legitimate authority whose fate or mandate can only be decided at a properly constituted meeting of members in good standing. “There is no serious authority or body under the sun that can approve and accept the decisions that were taken under a flawed unconstitutional process unless of course the process is its own creature. “We are aware, through their own admission, that some of the clubs were being coerced to attend such gatherings and that they don’t subscribe to such unconstitutional processes,” the statement read. “The executive committee has certainly no qualms with clubs raising their concerns about its representatives not attending meetings. “They need to know. The reasons were going to be given to them at the appropriate fora, but when one body cries more than the bereaved, discusses the matter at its meeting and does not engage the Executive committee over the matter but chooses other means to address it, it certainly raises eyebrows. “We are yet to see whether the speed and timeous attention that was given to the Southern Region will apply to other affiliates in the same hat with it,” further reads the letter. “Having said that, the executive committee is of the strong view that the clubs’ concerns are not the real substance but indeed there is an elephant in the house fighting for recognition. “Certain aspersions have been cast on the work and performance of the executive committee. In this regard there is a need to set the record straight especially in areas where blatant lies have been propagated.” It now remains to be seen how the national association will respond to the letter written to them by the clubs notifying them of the changes they made on December 19.— @innocentskizoe
