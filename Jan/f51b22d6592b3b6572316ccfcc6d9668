The grand winner stands a chance of driving away in a brand-new car and receive a cash prize of US$5 000. The winner of the coveted title will go on to represent the nation in June on the international stage.  Models who made it to the finals are Itumeleng Nare, Pauline Marere, Harriet Majoni, Melissa Sibanda, Natasha Masunda, Courtney Jongwe, Sibonginkosi Moyo, Chantel Kanyoka, Sicebi Moyo, Marvelous Ganje, Wendy Maturi, Scholastica Makoni, Tristana Matsongoni, Mitchele Simone, Zvashe Maponga, Eldah Chitate and Grace Masvavike.
