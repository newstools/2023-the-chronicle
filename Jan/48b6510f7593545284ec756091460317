The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Castle Lager Premier Soccer League champions Dynamos are in the process of seeking clearance from relevant authorities to participate  in the 2023 Nyasa Big Bullets Pre-Season International Tournament slated  for March 3-5 at Malawi’s Kamuzu Stadium. The tournament is set to return after a two-year break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Dynamos spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said while they will use the tournament to prepare for the new season and help their technical team assess the new squad, they were currently engaged in doing all the necessary paperwork to get a green light from the country’s sporting authority to feature at the international event. “It’s work in progress, we are in the process of doing all the necessary paperwork so that we get the clearance. These are administrative issues of which I will need to further check with our chief executive officer (Jonathan Mashingaidze),” said Farawo. Mashingaidze, a former Zifa head of sectariat who was appointed as DeMbare substantive chief executive officer at the end of 2022 also maintained they were working on getting the clearance. “We got the invitation to take part in this pre-season tournament late last year and as such all protocols are being handled in line within the SRC policy on regional and international tour or events.  “Against a background of the Zifa and Fifa fallout that has been widely talked about, we as Dynamos say whatever may be obtained in football must be informed by the needs on the ground and our core business is to play football local, regional and international. “This will be an important tournament for us which will help our technical team to have a look at our 2023 squad. There is so much need for us to take part in the tournament,” said Mashingaidze. Zifa acting general secretary, Xolisani Gwesela is said the blue and white army was yet to apply for permission to travel to Malawi. <img class="wp-image-450080 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Xolisani-Gwesela-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Xolisani-Gwesela-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Xolisani-Gwesela-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Xolisani Gwesela “They have not applied for the clearance. They need to get that clearance as guided by the SRC Act and we are yet to see that application,” said Gwesela. Besides Dynamos, the tournament will attract hosts Nyasa Bullets, Mighty Mukuru Wanderers and Mozambique champions UD Songo. However, Songo are reportedly yet to confirm their participation in the tournament. Bullets chief administration officer Albert Chigoga was quoted in the Malawian media saying two other teams are on standby. ’’Songo will confirm this week but we have plan B as two teams are anxiously waiting. It will be premature to disclose their names,’’ Chigoga said. During the 2019 edition, Zimbabwe’s Joey Antipas-mentored Chicken Inn, Songo, Wanderers and Bullets took part. Chicken Inn won the tournament. <img class="wp-image-601939 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chicken-Inn-coach-Joey-Antipas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chicken-Inn-coach-Joey-Antipas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Chicken-Inn-coach-Joey-Antipas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas Last season, Dynamos finished third in the local Premier Soccer League with 58 points from 34 matches,17 points behind champions FC Platinum. -@FungaiMuderere
