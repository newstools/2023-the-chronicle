The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Health Reporter IT was a hive of activity at Redan Petroleum in Bellevue as Bulawayo residents flocked the service station where they were rewarded with a five-litre fuel coupon for donating blood to boost the national blood bank.
The once-off partnership between Redan Petroleum and National Blood Services Zimbabwe (NBSZ) was meant to assist NBSZ to collect blood to boost stocks that were said to be critically low, with Bulawayo and Harare only having a day’s supply of blood. The initiative came after reports that the nation has been hit by a critical shortage of blood group type O.
Other participating sites were Redan Greencroft and Redan Flyover in Harare. According to the NBSZ, a pint of blood which measures 500ml can save three lives. <img class="wp-image-670534 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/5ytyty.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/5ytyty.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/5ytyty-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo residents flocked the service station where they were rewarded with a five-litre fuel coupon for donating blood to boost the national blood bank. Beneficiaries include pregnant women who sometimes bleed during delivery, accident victims and patients who require blood transfusion before surgeries.
By 2PM yesterday, the Bulawayo team had already surpassed its target of collecting 100 pints of blood from 10AM to 4PM.
One of the donors, Angela Zigandasa from Parklands said she started donating blood when her father died after failing to get blood three years ago. She said that has been the reason behind her donating and she aims at doing it at least once a year.
“I am here to donate blood as the year begins, it’s something I promised myself I would do regularly as long as I am healthy and strong. My father died a few years ago after we failed to get blood for him and that inspired me to be more considerate and save lives. I mean it’s just 500mls of blood that can avert deaths,” she said. <img class="size-large wp-image-670532" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/rtfrgfgfg-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/rtfrgfgfg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/rtfrgfgfg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Blood donation campaign “I call upon other residents to normalise this habit, it’s very easy, painless and worth it. We understand that incentives like fuel can help motivate people, but we should be ever willing to save lives.”
Tawanda Maguwu from Nketa 9 suburb said as a first-time donor, he was convinced the process is worth doing all the time as it was easy and painless. “I have never donated blood but after the campaigns on social media I decided to give it a try so that I too can play a part in saving lives. I call on other residents, especially everyone who is eligible to come forward and donate blood as many times as possible.”  NBSZ southern region blood donor co-ordinator Sifundo Ngwenya said the partnership with Redan Petroleum had yielded great results as they have never served so many people within a short space of time in a day. “Donors are flocking in their numbers as they respond to the call put through on social media where they are incentivised for donating. We are almost way over 80 units of blood, the room is full and this has been the trend since we opened our door at 9AM,” said Ngwenya.
“This blood drive will help boost our stocks and we are hoping that as learners go back to school, there will be no accidents so that the blood bank is not overwhelmed by demand. This partnership is once-off and we pray that our benefactors will continue assisting us with energisers as it is clear that residents were motivated.”
Ngwenya said donors will be welcome to donate their blood as the NBSZ office along JMN Nkomo Street opposite the Main Post Office remains open.
“We will do mobile campaigns and I urge all eligible residents to continue donating even after this incentive. We should always be willing to save lives even if there is no incentive.” -@thamamoe
