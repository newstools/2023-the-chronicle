The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter THE recently launched Zimbabwe Business Council which aims to promote Zimbabwean-owned companies registered in the United Arab Emirates is today set to attend its first ever inter-council networking. The Dubai Chamber of Commerce established the Zimbabwean Business Council, with the main objective of promoting the commercial interests of Zimbabwe and Zimbabwean businesses in Dubai. The launch of the Zimbabwe Business Council (ZIBCO) is in line with the Dubai Chamber’s plans to establish new country-specific business councils and expand their roles to boost UAE’s foreign trade while promoting cross-border business opportunities for member businesses and organisations. Bilateral trade between UAE and Zimbabwe has recently witnessed strong growth, especially between 2019 to 2021.
For instance, UAE imports from Zimbabwe reached about US$ 2,3 billion in 2021 compared to US$ 1,5 billion in 2020 and US$ 904 million in 2019. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-583172" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> On one hand, UAE exports to Zimbabwe accounted for US$209 million in 2021. The main products of trade between the two countries are precious stones and metals. Posting on its official Twitter handle yesterday, the Zimbabwe Business Council said it was looking forward to the engagement.
“On Wednesday the 25th of January 2023 we join other Business Councils for the 1st inter-council networking of 2023. Excited to start our journey on a high note,” it said.  On Monday, the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, one of the three chambers operating under Dubai Chambers announced new sector-specific business groups for four economic sectors: Agribusiness, Furniture and Home Furnishing, Flower Traders, and Tyre Traders.

Mohammad Ali Rashed Lootah, President and CEO of Dubai Chambers, said, “This latest raft of business groups is designed to encourage greater cooperation, mutual knowledge sharing and greater understanding of the synergies that exist between competitors in each sector, in terms of domestic, regional and international trading opportunities.” Lootah said that the aim is to promote the development of UAE-based companies and raise the profile of business group members in the international business community. <img class="size-large wp-image-667483" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/hdueddbwjeb-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/hdueddbwjeb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/hdueddbwjeb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa The launch of the council further buttresses Zimbabwe’s economic diplomacy-focused foreign policy, which is anchored on engagement and re-engagement with the global community.
