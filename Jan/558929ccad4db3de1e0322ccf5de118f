The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief THE Zanu-PF Matabeleland South Women’s League has intensified its voter mobilising exercise aimed at ensuring the ruling party achieves the targeted five million votes ahead of the forthcoming harmonised elections sometime this year. Speaking during a provincial inter-district meeting in Gwanda last Thursday, provincial Women’s League chairperson, Cde Sindisiwe Nleya, said it was now time for the women to take their mobilisation efforts up a notch and urged all members to be actively involved. Given their dominance in numbers when compared to men, she said women could influence the campaign in a big way and steer the party into victory. “The main objective of our league in the province is to mobilise fellow women in the province and beyond to join the party,” said Cde Nleya. “With the influence we have in society, we have to go a step further by mobilising not only women but other members of the community. Women are the peacemakers and achievers of sustainable development to attain Vision 2030. “As women, we are supposed to leave no place and no one behind as we mobilise votes. We are in the process of mobilising women in all districts to join the party. We are recruiting new members in order to contribute to five million plus for the President Dr. ED Mnangagwa in the 2023 harmonised elections.”  Cde Nleya said already, 50 new members recently joined the party during Malanswazi by-elections in Bulilima and in the Matobo district, urging members to scale up the campaign momentum. “Let’s rally behind the party and our President,” she said. Cde Nleya also urged women to use various platforms to mobilise new members, including on social media platforms. She said mobilisation is in progress in all seven districts where meetings are being vigorously held in various wards in conjunction with DCC members. Cde Nleya said urged members of the Women’s League to be united and set their differences aside saying no member should pursue selfish interests at the expense of the party. “The Government under the leadership of our President Mnangagwa has done a lot to empower people and improve Livelihoods. This is the information that we should sell to the People,” she said. “Let’s not jeopardise what our Government and President have done because of selfish agendas. Let’s remain united as women as we are the backbone of society and party. As Mat South, we unanimously agreed that we are fully behind our President, Dr ED Mnangagwa, and now is the time to prove this.” <img class="wp-image-611752 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-39.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-39.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-39-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) Cde Nleya also urged women to take up various leadership roles in the party and community saying the Government has put in place various economic empowerment activities for women so as to improve their livelihoods.
