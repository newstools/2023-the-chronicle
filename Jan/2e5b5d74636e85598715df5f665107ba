The Chronicle   Mthabisi Tshuma, Online Reporter TOUTED as one of the best dance groups to emerge in 2022, Asante Mo has now set its eyes on performing on international stages. Starting off as an outfit that stood to promote the solo careers of three artistes, Aaron Chikondawanga aka DJ Beast, Bekithemba Phiri aka Beckx Marabha and Newman Trindad aka Daiman, the group has turned out to be a favourite, not only in Bulawayo but across the Southern African region. Last year, the group managed to make their maiden performance in Harare and South Africa. In Bulawayo, they have turned out to be a household name performing at local clubs, week in and week out, weddings, and most recently, at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards where they left many in awe with their energetic and synchronised musical act. To ensure their stay in the industry is not swung, last month, the trio released their debut song titled Going Away. The song was made uploaded on platforms that include YouTube yesterday. A combination of drums and the decks, the group is made up of a DJ and two dancers with their dance being called afro-tech. Chronicle Showbiz caught up with the outfit which expressed its zeal to perform on international stages and make its unique act known worldwide. “We had a great year last year as we managed to perform on big stages with big names, something which was an eye-opener for us. Now, we’re really looking forward to penetrating the international market as most of our audiences claim our act is international so we’re pushing hard to be recognised globally,” said Daiman. Commenting on their debut track Daiman said: “The track is a GBV-oriented one where one is tired of being emotionally, physically and mentally abused, thus she is deciding to leave his man because of being irresponsible. We seek to promote love, peace, and unity through the track. Going forward, people should brace for more music from us.” – @mthabisi_mthire
