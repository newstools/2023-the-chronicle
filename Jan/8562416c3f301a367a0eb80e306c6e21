The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter MATABELELAND Squash doubles league has commenced for the new season which began on Monday at Suburbs and Old Miltonians with over 40 pairs. League matches will be played every Monday across a period of 10 weeks in the same venues where there will be six courts. Of the six courts, four are at Suburbs Squash Club and two are at Old Miltonians. The league is made up of six sections. After the completion of the 10 weeks, the top teams will earn promotion to the next higher league while the bottom two will be relegated to the lower leagues. With matches taking place on Mondays only, all games must be completed on the same day and scores sent in to the officials by Wednesday of the same week. Failure to submit a score on the day results in 0-0. There will be five weeks for the first round and after, sections will be ranked. The winning pair of each section will move up a section and the lowest pair in the section will move down a section.  After the completion of the first half, the next five weeks’ rotation will be drawn up. Resumption of the league comes after the city hosted the 2022 Senior Squash Championship which was dominated by powerhouse Egypt who won both the singles and team events. The championships were played at four different venues across Bulawayo; Suburbs, Holiday Inn, Christian Brothers College (CBC) and Old Miltonians. <img class="alignnone wp-image-621025 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-4-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-4-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-4-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Christian Brothers College (CBC) The year promises to be a busy one for Zimbabwe Squash who are set to participate in All Africa Games to be held in Ghana in August after the sport was readmitted into the games. World Juniors will also take place later in the year and Zimbabwe is expected to take part. With the All Africa Games scheduled for August, the traditional Zimbabwe Open which takes place in the same month will likely be moved to another date. A singles league is also expected to take place which will run concurrently with the doubles. For the doubles league, cost is US$10 per player which is payable to administrators of the tournament. -@brandon_malvin
