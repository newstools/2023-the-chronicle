THE Veterinary Services Department in Matabeleland South Province in conjunction with its Botswana counterpart has, in a bid to contain transboundary diseases, rolled out a campaign to educate farmers in border-lying areas against allowing their livestock to stray into the neighbouring country. In an interview, Matabeleland South provincial veterinary officer, Dr Enat Mdlongwa said the campaign which started yesterday was also part of efforts to fight cases of stock theft. <img class="wp-image-598877 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Enat-Mdlongwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Enat-Mdlongwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Enat-Mdlongwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Enat Mdlongwa “We agreed with our Botswana counterparts that we are going to engage communities along the common boundary from Plumtree right up to Beitbridge. We will be teaching people about transboundary diseases, the sovereignty between the two countries and about boundaries between Zimbabwe and Botswana. “Our first venue will be Shashe in Beitbridge then will continue to Gwanda right up to Plumtree. A high powered delegation from Botswana is here comprising vet officers, security forces and an ambassador. We will be meeting with communities in these areas. These meetings with run up to 25 January. From there our Botswana counterparts will invite us on a day yet to be advised so that we can conduct the meetings in communities on the Botswana side. We will try to hold these community engagement meetings twice a year for better results,” he said.  Dr Mdlongwa said there is a national park just after Shashe area on the Botswana side: Northern Tuli Game Reserve which people in Shashe think is on the Zimbabwean side hence they drive their animals to graze there.–@DubeMatutu
