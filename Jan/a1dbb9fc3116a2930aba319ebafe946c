Popularly known as the Castle Corner, they have proved to be an integral part of Zimbabwe at the recently concluded Twenty20 International series against Ireland at Harare Sports Club where they were up in song, throughout the duration of the matches. Cheering through their beloved Chevrons, bringing an electric atmosphere to Harare Sports Club, the fans have won the hearts of the Irish internationals due to their love for the game.
“The best atmosphere I’ve ever seen at an international match as over 10 000 fans made the Harare Sports Club bounce to every single moment as the series went right to the wire with Zimbabwe Cricket taking it 2-1!” wrote commentator Andrew Leonard on his Twitter account.  Leonard is not the only one to have been charmed by the love Zimbabweans have for the game, Ireland captain Andy Balbirnie was also impressed by the crowds at Harare Sports Club, pitting them just behind giants India.
“Apart from when you play India, it’s probably the best atmosphere to play in. It’s really nice, it’s not hostile, it’s friendly, and everyone loves to be here and it’s great to play in front of. We want to play good cricket and entertain people whether it’s here, whether it’s at home, or wherever it is. We have really enjoyed the crowd and hopefully, it continues,” said Balbirnie. <img class="wp-image-655106 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Dave-Houghton-post-match-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Dave-Houghton-post-match-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Dave-Houghton-post-match-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dave Houghton The Chevrons won the T20I series, which was both teams’ first outing of the year, 2-1 in front of their buzzing fans.
