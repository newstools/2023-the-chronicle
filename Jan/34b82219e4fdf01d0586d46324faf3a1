The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PRESENTATION of the amended Highlanders Football Club constitution for adoption by its bonafide members will headline the Bosso annual general meeting. Paid up Highlanders members will congregate at the Clubhouse on Sunday, January 29. In a reminder to members, Highlanders stated: “Further to the AGM notice published in the Sunday News of 8 January 2023, this serves as a reminder to all members in good standing that the presentation of the amended constitution for endorsement or ratification will be the major highlight of AOB (where due notice has been given).” The club said a bonafide member in need of the constitution can request it by emailing to communications@highlandersfc.co.zw and provide proof that they are of good standing. The constitutional amendment proposal meant to make the club compliant with Fifa Club Licencing and improve Bosso’s administration, was submitted by club member Innocent Mikazhu ahead of last year’s annual general meeting. Bosso set up a committee led by board member Nicholas Nyathi to look into the constitutional amendment process.  At last year’s midyear meeting, Nyathi gave a snippet of some of the amendments to be done, which include avoiding duplication of duties that presently spell out in the constitution between the executive committee secretary and the CEO. Should members agree to the amendments, the CEO will have his responsibilities spelt out as required by Fifa on how to run the club, making him a club signatory and will be responsible for all the club’s correspondence presently done by the secretary. Club correspondence, recording of minutes, keeping of player records, which includes renewal of contracts and player registrations as spelt out by the present constitution, will be the CEO’s responsibilities. The amended constitution, if given the green light by the members will also see the abolishing of the secretary, treasurer and committee member’s titles as well as their roles. Another key item to note in the amended constitution is that an ordinary or life member attached to a certain club will not be allowed to participate in decision making processes of Highlanders such as voting, even though he or she retains membership status. <img class="size-large wp-image-670253" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jhgsdsf-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jhgsdsf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jhgsdsf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andrew Tandi signs new Highlanders contract in the presence of CEO Ronald Moyo Meanwhile, Highlanders members attending the AGM will be informed of which players are contracted to the club as well as the duration of those deals.
