RESIDENTS of Njube suburb in Bulawayo have gone for weeks without electricity after thieves stole copper cables on New Year’s Eve resulting in parts of the area plunging into darkness.
Of late, theft of copper cables has been a growing menace in Bulawayo with suburbs such as Hillside, Burnside, Mpopoma, Waterford and Entumbane being the worst affected. The Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) is now in the process of replacing copper cables with aluminium ones. ZETDC is seeking a review of the sentence for individuals convicted of stealing power cables and transformers from 10 years to 30 years to curb the vice that is prejudicing Zesa Holdings of more than US$2 million annually. <img class="wp-image-674094 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jjhyytfgdv.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jjhyytfgdv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jjhyytfgdv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stolen cables. ZETDC requires more than US$14 million to procure intruder detection gadgets to fight the scourge that continues to bleed the power utility. Possession of copper cables without a valid licence now attracts a mandatory 10-year prison sentence without the option of a fine under new regulations meant to deter vandalism of key utilities. The Copper Control Amendment Act has been amended to raise the minimum sentence for illegal possession of copper from two years to a mandatory 10 years. According to the new Act, it is now mandatory for all copper dealers to have certificates of origin for the metal in their possession. <img class="wp-image-634999 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) Courts have been empowered to forfeit to the State any vehicle or any other device used in transporting the illegal copper.
Yesterday, a Chronicle news crew visited the affected suburb and observed that some copper cables had been removed from the poles. Residents said cases of copper cable theft are on the increase.
Mrs Rachael Kusanzira said they have gone for almost a month without electricity. “We last had electricity last year on New Year’s Eve celebrations after thieves struck in the middle of the night and stole copper cables, We reported the matter to the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company,” she said.  Mrs Kusanzira said a few days later, the thieves struck again and took more cables from the power line resulting in more houses in the suburb being affected. “I cannot say the exact number of houses that have been affected, but the blackout has affected the entire neighbourhood with over 50 houses without power,” she said. Mrs Clemencia Dlodlo said the blackout has affected her business.
“Not only has the cable theft left us in darkness, but it has also affected our businesses as well. I operate from my house where I sell fruits and other perishable products, which require refrigeration,” she said. “I was left with no choice, but to sell my products at half the price to avoid incurring losses.”
Moses Dube said thieves are now taking advantage of the power blackout to steal from them at night. <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay “We are now forced to go home early for fear of being mugged as criminals are now taking advantage of the darkness to attack people,” he said. ZETDC western region manager Engineer Lloyd Jaji said they are concerned over rampant theft of copper cables. He said they are in process of restoring power in the affected areas. “Vandalism is rampant all across the city and it is also a national problem. We are in the process of replacing the stolen copper cables with aluminum cables. By the end of the week, we would have restored electricity,” he said.
Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said they are investigating several cases of theft of copper cables in the city. <img class="wp-image-669428 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube He said they have also intensified night patrols. Insp Ncube urged residents to assist police with information that could lead to the arrest of suspects. Last year in November, residents of Hillcrest suburb in the city went for a week without electricity after thieves stole copper cables along Berkshire Avenue in the suburb. — @Sagepapie14
