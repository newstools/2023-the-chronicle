The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter PAID up Highlanders Football Club members are set to convene at the Bosso Clubhouse on January 29 for their Annual General Meeting. The meeting will follow the usual agenda of reading a notice convening the meeting, reading of previous annual general meeting minutes, matters arising from the previous minutes, chairman’s report, treasurer’s report, receiving and adoption of board’s report, confirmation of legal representatives and discussion of business that due notice would have been given. <img class="wp-image-670942 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tdrgtfgf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tdrgtfgf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tdrgtfgf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joel Luphahla Another topical issue at the AGM could be the status of assistant coach Joel Luphahla.
It is reported the club’s board of directors have instructed the Johnfat Sibanda led executive committee to relieve assistant coach Luphahla of his duties because he does not possess the requisite Caf A coaching badge after requests for an exemption last season were turned down by Zifa.  The situation seems to have divided opinion amongst the Bosso family and could be topical come January 29.
In his notice of the AGM, the clubs executive committee secretary Morgen “Gazza” Dube encouraged members to regularise their membership. “All members are also encouraged to regularise their membership by submitting the details, ID number, email address, and phone number at Highlanders offices or sending scanned copies,” reads the club’s notice. <img class="wp-image-428091 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Bukhosi-“Zakhu”-Sibanda.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Bukhosi-“Zakhu”-Sibanda.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Bukhosi-“Zakhu”-Sibanda-360x202.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bukhosi “Zakhu” Sibanda Highlanders members will at the AGM be informed of which players are contracted to the club as well as the duration of those deals. So far, Bosso have announced the departure of Bukhosi “Zakhu” Sibanda following the expiry of his contract at the end of 2022. Amahlolanyama have promoted Gillian Nyathi from Bosso90, recalled goalkeeper Reward Muza from his loan spell at Bulawayo City and extended the contract of defender Andrew Tandi. — @innocentskizoe
