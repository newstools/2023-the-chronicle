The Chronicle    Michael Makuza, Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) has set up an electronic-tax platform that enables businesses to submit separate tax returns for local and foreign currencies. “Taxpayers are advised to utilize the facility in submitting their separate returns for income tax, value-added tax, and PAYE on the E-Taxes platform,” said Zimra in a latest notice. “Please note that the submission of foreign currency returns is through an allocated BP number, which starts with a “3”, which has been emailed to all taxpayers.” The tax body has also urged its clients to approach their nearest Zimra office for assistance where needed. Zimra is embracing digital services in line with global trends with the country also accelerating its digitalization transformation drive, especially in the financial services sector. The digitalization drive gained higher momentum following the outbreak of Covid-19, which resulted in limited physical interactions as the country implemented lockdown measures to contain the virus.
