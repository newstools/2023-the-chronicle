The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Football Association technical director Wilson Mutekede says Caf A holding coaches will need to ratify their licences at a refresher course to be held next month as most of them are in possession of expired licences. Mutekede highlighted that the badge must be validated after every three years and having last held a Caf A course in 2017 most coaches have licences that need renewal a situation that will see those that would not have validated their certificates disallowed from seating on the technical team bench this coming season. The refresher course is scheduled to run from February 20-25 at Oriel Boys High in Harare.
“The Zimbabwe Football Association hereby invites Caf A licensed coaches of all elite league clubs to attend a Caf A licence refresher course. <img class="wp-image-608812 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede “All participants are required to carry a training kit, stopwatch, whistle, and a medical certificate certifying them fit to partake in physical activities. “All Premier Soccer League clubs should kindly note that the course’s certification will be a prerequisite for their coaches to be accredited to sit on the technical bench for the 2023 season,” reads a note from Zifa.
The course fee is yet to be availed. “We will be bringing in a foreign instructor so we will be hearing from our accounts department what amount to charge and revealing the course fee soon,” said Mutekede.
“We are saying every coach who has their Caf A badge must validate their certificate. According to the Caf statutes, a licence must be validated by a refresher course after every three years.  “We last held a Caf A course in 2017 which means most of our coaches’ certificates need to be renewed for them to be valid. This is a normal validation refresher course,” said Mutekede.
According to the standardisation Zifa is enforcing for local football, Premiership gaffers and their assistants must have a Caf A badge as the minimum qualification to sit on the bench this season. Division One coaches should have a minimum of Caf B while assistant coaches are required to be holders of a Caf C or Zifa Level Four licence. <img class="wp-image-597613 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/zifa-cc.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/zifa-cc.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/zifa-cc-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zifa In the Second Division, a coach should have a Caf C licence while his assistant should have a Level Three qualification.
The coaching standards have been cascaded down to Division Three, tertiary institutions, and schools. For secondary schools, a Zifa Level Two badge is mandatory, and primary school football coaches should have at least a Level Two certificate. -@innocentskizoe
