The Chronicle Rutendo Nyeve, Chronicle Reporter THE Second Republic has engaged ex-ZIPRA combatants as the war veterans seek to recover their properties in line with President Mnangagwa’s policy to address all issues arising from past conflicts. On Saturday, hundreds of ex-Zipra combatants drawn from all the country’s 10 provinces convened at McDonald Hall in Mzilikazi suburb in Bulawayo to select a 13-member committee that will compile a list of the properties and engage Government. The meeting was convened by Colonel (Retired) Tshinga Dube as instructed by Zanu-PF’s Second Secretary Cde Kembo Mohadi. <img class="wp-image-674963 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Colonel-Retired-Tshinga-Dube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Colonel-Retired-Tshinga-Dube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Colonel-Retired-Tshinga-Dube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Colonel (Retired) Tshinga Dube The 13-member committee that was constituted has Cde Volta Moyo from Matabeleland South as chairman; Cde Queen Maligwa from Matabeleland North as vice-chairperson, Cde Buster Magwizi from Mashonaland West as information and publicity secretary. Addressing the ex-combatants, Rtd Col Dube said President Mnangagwa and his Government were willing to hand over the properties if the ex-combatants adhere to a transparent procedure. “A number of groups pursued the case without any clear outcomes. Recently, I may say after the new dispensation, President Mnangagwa came with a new policy that all outstanding problems from the first Government must be transparently solved, that’s even the sensitive Gukurahundi issue. “Most comrades who approached the President were told that the Government was willing to hand over the properties provided that we go through Vice-President Mohadi’s office. Recently Vice-President Mohadi called me to his office and gave me an order that we form a committee that will be able to come up with an inventory of all ZIPRA properties which will be sent to Vice-President Mohadi by the committee,” said Rtd Col Dube. Rtd Col Dube said when the country gained independence and the ZIPRA combatants returned home, they were sent to seven assembly points. He said it was during this period that a decision was made that only a fraction of the fighters could not be integrated as Government had decided that the new army (ZNA) could not carry more than 60 000 members. “A plan was made for the thousands that would not be integrated which saw them contributing a minimum of $50 each for the purposes of purchasing farms, buildings, and other commercial entities that would help them avoid destitution. “However, due to the teething problems that the country went through between 1982 and 1987, some of the properties were confiscated by the then Government led by Prime Minister Robert Mugabe,” said Rtd Col Dube.  Rtd Col Dube also noted that the Zimbabwe National Army also bought farms under the operation Seed to accommodate other comrades who had not been integrated. Rtd Col Dube emphasised that the ex- combatants should not mix Zapu properties with Zipra ones as they were integrated into Zanu PF when the unity accord was signed. Rtd Col Dube said when the properties are returned, a board shall be formed to discuss the distribution or methods to cater for all shareholders with those who have passed on being represented by their widows or children. — @nyeve14
