Answer: My real name is Nicholas Muchinguri. I was born in Makoni in a family of four. Q: How did you venture into music? A: I learnt at Plumtree High School where I took part in many talent shows and it’s from this school that I got to sharpen my skills as a rapper. I later went on to participate in freestyle competitions and hip-hop shows from where I grew to become the artiste that I am now. Q: The song The Good Guy, what inspired it and who did you work with? A: I was simply trying to figure out if people, especially women, like good guys or the bad boys. Q: How have you managed to stay relevant in the music industry? A: Always changing with the times and trying out new sounds and styles. Q: They say hip-hop in Bulawayo is dead, what is your take on that? A: I think Bulawayo hip-hop is very much alive. Artistes like Luminous Msiz’kay and Asaph have been representing us very well. Q: What do you think artistes from the city can do in order to be recognised? A: I think they need to get more national exposure so as to get bookings at big events because it’s all about numbers. Q: Lastly, what is your advice to up-and-coming artistes? A: Never give up on your dreams. It may mean doing three different things at the same time but keep pushing.
