The Chronicle Ricky Zililo in Hwange
THE late seasoned football administrator Dennis Tshuma received a befitting send-off yesterday as hundreds of people paid their last respects to the man they described as a servant of the game. Better known as Dadegulu, Tshuma was buried at his rural home in Kasibo Village in Hwange District.
Acting Zifa president Gift Banda described Tshuma as a football “kingmaker” who selflessly served the game.
Tshuma (54) who died last Tuesday, was one of the longest serving Zifa councillors having assumed his role as far back as 2003.  “We have lost a servant of the game who was a kingmaker in his own right. When it came to Zifa elections, Tshuma always went with the winning team. He was always there to give advice and if one didn’t take his counsel, Dadegulu would leave him. He was adored by many here in Matabeleland North and was the go to person in terms of football not only in this province but across the country,” Banda said. Representing the Zifa Southern Region, Gaylord Madunguza described Tshuma as a doyen of football administration. “Death has robbed us of a great football man who took some of us under his wing since the playing days up to now when  I’ve grown in football to be at Caf. Tshuma always gave us guidance. He was calculating and could foretell what lay ahead in football politics. “His death has brought us together and my plea is that we should unite irrespective of the differences. That you have come here to pay the last respect to Tshuma shows Ubuntu,” Madunguza said.  Clevious Ncube, the Zifa Matabeleland North secretary said Tshuma was the pillar for development and spreading football in the area. Referees’ representative Warren Phiri said: “As referees we’re at a loss of words following the death of Tshuma. He dedicated his life to football and was keen on seeing the development of referees.” <img class="wp-image-673126 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-52-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-52-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-52-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prominent soccer personnel were the pallbearers At the time of his death, Tshuma was part of the national referees committee as a co-ordinator.
