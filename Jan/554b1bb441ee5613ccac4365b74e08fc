The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Castle Lager Premier Soccer League champions Chicken Inn started their pre-season training sessions on Monday amid revelations that the club has parted ways with speedy winger Malvin Gaki.

This is a preliminary stage that allows our coaches to meet the players and also assess them. With some of our players still coming in from different locations, I can confirm that Malvin Gaki’s contract with us expired at the end of last year and he did not renew it,” said Hara. The player, who also had a playing stint at Harare City, is said to have joined Mhondoro based Ngezi Platinum Stars.
“We haven’t heard anything from Ngezi Platinum Stars and these days players get cleared online. As such, we can’t comment further,” added Hara.  With nimble footed Clive “Gringo” Dzingai, veteran midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu, stocky and pacey striker Brian Muza, goalkeepers Donovan Bernard and Pride Zendera, seasoned right back Passmore Bernard, left footed defender Xolisani “Lolo” Ndlovu, towering duo of Vincent Moyo and Itai Mabunu, combative Richard Hachiro and Denzel Khumalo among others further committing to the club, the Simbisa Brands-sponsored outfit is set to officially reunite with forward Obriel Chirinda who was formerly with Bulawayo Chiefs. At the end of November last year Gamecocks beat Dynamos to the signature of highly rated ex-Young Warriors forward, Calum English Brown.
