The incidents occurred between Wednesday and Saturday last week. The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) and Department of Civil Protection issued a warning and urged the public to exercise caution in light of heavy rains and flooding, which hit the country between Friday and yesterday. A villager from Mawaza Village under Chief Mathe area in Gwanda District was swept away while trying to cross Mlenje River.
Chronicle news crew visited the area on Saturday and spoke to Aggrey Ndlovu’s family.  The deceased’s son, Mr Prosper Degree Ndlovu (51) said his father was swept away by the river last Wednesday while trying to cross the flooded river. The body was found the following day. “As a family, we are saddened by the death of my father after he was swept away while trying to cross Mlenje River. He was coming from a nearby business centre and heading back home when the incident occurred,” he said. “What worries us as a family is that there were people who were around him and could have restrained him from crossing the river, but they did nothing.”  The deceased’s nephew, Mr Peter Ndlovu who witnessed the incident said they were drinking beer at the shops when it started raining. “We were drinking beer at the shops at around 4pm when it started raining. We then left the place and headed home and when we arrived at a crossing area, the river was in flood and a lot of people were standing on banks,” he said. “My uncle insisted that he wanted to cross the river despite pleas from other people. He was immediately swept away and we tried to search for him until late at night without any success.” Mr Ndlovu said they received a phone call the following day from some villagers in the neighbouring Pelela village after they had found the body.  The deceased was buried yesterday at his homestead in Mawaza. Eight classrooms at Matshiya Primary School under Chief Masuku had their rooms completely blown off. When the news crew arrived at the scene, the debris of asbestos roofing sheets was strewn all over the schoolyard. Books were soaked in water while window panes were broken with pieces on the floor. Some zinc roofing sheets which were blown off were thrown several metres away. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-670850" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ujklj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ujklj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ujklj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> At Simbumbumbu Primary School in Wenlock area under Ward 7 in Gwanda, a classroom block had its roof blown off while 21 homes were also affected. Elderly people in the area said the storm was the most destructive they had ever seen in their lives. One of the villagers whose home was destroyed by the heavy rains, Mr Phumuza Dube of Matshiya, shared a harrowing experience of how he scurried for cover as the roof of his bedroom was being blown off by the strong winds. “It was around 4pm on Thursday and I was busy harvesting amacimbi when heavy rains accompanied by strong winds started. There was a terrifyingly violent storm and I immediately rushed to my bedroom,” he said. <img class="size-large wp-image-670880" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jngerkl-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jngerkl.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jngerkl-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland South floods Tuli river Minutes later, the foundation of his house started shaking as the structure took a pounding from the rain and strong winds.
Mr Dube said he stormed out of the house and went to another hut from where he watched helplessly as the structure collapsed. “The wind tore off the roof and bits of plaster rained into the house. I have never been so afraid. I watched helplessly as the roof and trusses of my entire house were blown off,” he said. Gwanda district development coordinator Mr Thulani Moyo said the estimated cost of property lost following the destruction of the two schools is US$25 000. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-670858" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tr3erwer-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tr3erwer.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tr3erwer-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We are appealing to well-wishers to assist in rebuilding the two schools, which were extensively damaged by the heavy rains. A total of 21 homes were also affected in Matshiya and Simbumbumbu areas,” he said. Another victim, Mr Sifelani Ndlovu said he lost stocks of maize meal and fertiliser while roofing sheets were damaged beyond repair. He said she had no words to describe the horror of his experience. Ms Thembelihle Moyo said neighbours helped her remove some of the household property, which had been soaked in water after the wind damaged the roof of her house. <img class="size-large wp-image-670879" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jkbnlobh-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jkbnlobh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jkbnlobh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland South floods motosist cross Tuli river bridge “Some of the property was heavily soaked in water while my bed was damaged.
