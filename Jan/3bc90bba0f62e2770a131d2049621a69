The information was important in that it led to the application for a search warrant which empowered our police officers to search the houses in question and it led to the arrest of the suspects and the recovery of the drugs,” said Insp Ncube. He said the suspects will go to court for prosecution. Insp Ncube thanked members of the public for giving tips that lead to arrest of criminals. @ReeSibanda
