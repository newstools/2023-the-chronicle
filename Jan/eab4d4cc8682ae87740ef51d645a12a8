Cde Maboyi said in some places, bridges have been damaged and that there is an urgent need for relevant authorities to intervene.

We are yet to calculate the losses, but we will need a lot of money to repair the roofs and restock,” he said. “At the same time we are appealing to the Beitbridge Rural District Council to attend to drainage issues at the business centre to avoid the recurrence of these incidents”. So far, the worst affected roads are those linking Shashe, Toporo, Zezani, Limpopo, Masera, and Dumba with the town.
