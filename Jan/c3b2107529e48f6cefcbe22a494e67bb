THE Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) has planted 25 hectares of sorghum at Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme in Binga with plans underway to increase the hecterage to 100ha. The authority is also working on putting another 100 hectares under sunflower. The planting was delayed by the late delivery of a planter which was only done on January 4.
Government has been working hard to ensure that the 15 000 hectare irrigation scheme is operational after a number of false starts since 2004.  The Second Republic is prioritising the revival of irrigation schemes because rain-fed crop production is no longer sustainable due to climate change. Government wants Binga district to enhance food security by growing crops under irrigation. Arda is now in charge of the Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme after taking over from the Department of Irrigation.
Pipe bursts have over the years derailed efforts to fully implement the project which at one stage employed close to 200 people. <img class="wp-image-612421 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-111.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-111.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-111-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda) Attempts to put some crops under irrigation have faltered because of technical faults and last year Arda awarded a tender to re-do piping which included repair, redirecting pipes and installing a new pumping and piping system to draw water from the nearby Zambezi River. The scheme has seven centre pivots which means it can irrigate several hectares. The project manager Mr Pitigoli Muleya said they have engaged 10 workers to speed up application of herbicides before the crops fully germinate. <img class="wp-image-673226 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wsaqws.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wsaqws.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wsaqws-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The pictures show farming processes at Arda Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme in Binga “Planting effectively began on 5 January with 25ha of sorghum. We got a tractor recently and rains also started after New Year which is why planting delayed. We are planning to put 100ha of sorghum and another 100ha of sunflower if all goes according to plan,” said Mr Muleya. He said after planting, they will fix the perimeter fence which was damaged by livestock. Bulawayo Kraal Irrigation Scheme has 99 members from Dumbwe and Bulawayo Kraal villages.
Once fully implemented, the scheme will see the nearby Manjolo area being transformed into a fully-fledged Growth Point with houses for workers, a police station and clinic. The nearby Bulawayo Kraal Primary and Secondary schools will also benefit.
