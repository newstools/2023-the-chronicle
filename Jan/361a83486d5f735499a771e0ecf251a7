The Chronicle 3 John 1:2
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.(NKJV)
THE devil wants to control your soul and body, in order to eventually have control over your spirit. The devil tried to have control over Jesus by offering Him the whole world if Jesus would just bow down to him (Matthew 4). In the same way, satan offers believers things that they want in order to wound them and ultimately destroy them. It becomes a battle because there might be certain memories that your flesh likes to bring up. Your flesh enjoys flashbacks and familiar feelings associated with these memories. This could be a place or a song that reminds you of someone or of an event that took place. If these thoughts are negative they could make you begin to dwell on how you have been wronged and you will find yourself having a conversation about how you would like to repay those wrongs.  The soul is the seed of your memory and desire. It encapsulates what we were. It holds scars of things that happened and of things that we might not even remember. Satan uses such memories to control you and make you feel worthless and to cause <img class="alignnone wp-image-570964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> problems in your life. Therefore if any man be in Christ He is a new creature. The spirit changes quickly but the soul and the body takes longer to change and adapt. Spending time reading the Word, spending time in prayer and learning from godly teachers helps you to renew your soul.
The Bible says, as a man thinks in his heart so he become. We therefore need to renew our minds so that we do not dwell on negative thoughts.  2 Corinthians 10:5
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.(NIV)
2 Corinthians 10:5
We use our powerful God-tools for smashing warped philosophies, tearing down barriers erected against the truth of God, fitting every loose thought and emotion and impulse into the structure of life shaped by Christ.(MSG)
God Bless.
