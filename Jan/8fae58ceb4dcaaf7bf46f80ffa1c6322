BULAWAYO city, just like other towns and cities in Zimbabwe, had residential areas allocated according to race before Independence. Europeans, Africans, referred to at that time as “natives,” Indians and coloureds had separate suburbs. All European suburbs were in the eastern, southern or northern side of the city’s industrial area and the suburbs were Kumalo, Hillside, Matsheumhlophe, Riverside, Famona, Waterford, Douglasdale, Burnside, Four Winds, Eloana, Montrose, Bellevue, North End, Sauerstown, Queens Park and Bradfield. Those for coloureds were Barham Green, Thorngrove, Rangemore and Trenance. Initially, the Indian community did not have a special residential area unlike in Harare where Belvedere was primarily meant for them. However, in Bulawayo, Highmount, adjacent to and on the western side of State House, was initially meant for the Indian community.  Africans were originally confined to the “Old Location or “Makokoba”, a stone’s throw from Lobhengula Street. Oral tradition has it that the name “Makokoba” was derived from a white superintendent of that high density suburb who would crouch in the bush to frighten residents who wanted to relieve themselves in the bush. Other high density suburbs that were built after Makokoba were Nguboyenja, named in memory of King Lobhengula’s son, Mzilikazi and Barbourfields built on land formerly owned by Mr Barbour, a former Bulawayo mayor. <img class="wp-image-672847 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Saturday-Chronicle-Ernest-Maphepha-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Saturday-Chronicle-Ernest-Maphepha-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Saturday-Chronicle-Ernest-Maphepha-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Ernest Maphepha Sibanda Luveve suburb was later built to accommodate what was regarded as middle-class black people. Njube which was called West Commonage Number Three and also named after Lobhengula’s son, followed.
Near Njube high-density suburb, the city council built West Commonage Number One (Iminyela) and West Commonage Number Two (Mabuthweni). Further to the northwest, Old Pumula was built and so was Hyde Park. Mpopoma and Tshabalala high-density suburbs were built in the middle of the 1950s and early 1960s. The name Mpopoma was chosen because the area has wetlands, with more or less perennial springs (impopoma zamanzi) at a number of places. <img class="wp-image-672851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Saturday-Chronicle-Thandazani-Zimbwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Saturday-Chronicle-Thandazani-Zimbwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Saturday-Chronicle-Thandazani-Zimbwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thandazani Zimbwa Saturday Chronicle this week focuses on famous persons who lived or are still living in Mpopoma suburb.
