Mr Infantino defended his actions and said in an Instagram post that Pele’s team-mates asked to take a photo with him, adding that he is “dismayed” by the criticism. Pele underwent treatment for colon cancer since 2021. The medical centre where he had been treated said he died of multiple organ failure as a result of the cancer. Dubbed the ‘king of soccer’, Pele played for Santos from 1956 to 1974, scoring more than 1,000 goals. He played almost his entire club career at Santos, a satellite city of Sao Paulo, where he grew up. – Sky UK
