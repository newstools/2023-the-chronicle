With the ball, Hasan Mahmud finished with the best figures for Riders, taking three wickets, conceding 20 overs in 3.1 overs. Robiul Haque also took two wickets, conceding 33 runs in four overs. Raza is set to miss the Chevrons’ T20I series against Ireland starting on Thursday at Harare Sports Club after he was granted permission by ZC to play franchise cricket in Bangladesh.
