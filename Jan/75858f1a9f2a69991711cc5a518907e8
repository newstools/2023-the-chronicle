The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Football Association Restructuring Committee (ZRC) recommendations to the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) have been made public with the Zifa constitutional amendment topping the list of things to be done. The Restructuring Committee noted that the Zifa constitution has a number of weaknesses that need to be attended to.
“The constitution must state that the laws of Zimbabwe take precedence over all other rules and regulations of Zifa,” reads part of the excerpt. “The registration of Zifa’s constitution with the SRC infers this but the document must be explicit in this respect.”
Input from stakeholders is guiding the recommendations made by the Restructuring Committee. “This model template relies on the late Fifa statutes as guidance for a new Zifa constitution and is informed by the views of the Zimbabwean public. “This draft properly redistributes power within the structures of Zifa, ensures for more participatory representation, clear definitions, term limits, additional checks and balances against the abuse of power and the elimination of duplicative structures.  “It recommends that the constitution should bar public office holders from running for Zifa office to avoid actual and perceived conflicts of interests, or politicising the association for personal glory,” it further reads. The committee also urged the Government to have direct budgetary and administration support for the Warriors and Mighty Warriors teams. <img class="size-large wp-image-585245" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-15-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-15-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-15-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Felton Kamambo Other recommendations touched on the need to have a standardised system that will help develop vibrant junior and women’s leagues and competitions.
