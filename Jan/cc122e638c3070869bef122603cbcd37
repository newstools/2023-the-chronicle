FRESH from winning the Outstanding Gospel Artist award at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) last month, Everton Mlalazi has not wasted any time as he has released a new single, a collaboration with multi-award-winning imbube group, Black Mambazo. The single titled Nomakunje was released on New Year’s Day. Mlalazi said he was overjoyed to have worked with the acclaimed Imbube group from South Africa. “Working with Black Mambazo taught me how to work in humility. They don’t talk that much, they let their work speak for itself. These guys have won five Grammy awards and they travel the whole world sharing their gift – something that one can only dream of. <img class="wp-image-610507 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-117.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-117.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-117-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Roil Bulawayo Arts Award “They connected with the song and gave it their best shot. My fans will, without doubt, love what we produced for them,” said a confident Mlalazi. The song is a rendition and remix of a popular traditional gospel song, Nomakunje.  If ever there is doubt about Mlalazi’s musical talent, the song puts to rest all those doubts as his soulful voice blended well with the world-acclaimed Black Mambazo. The song which is accompanied by a video was spiced up with excellent instrumentals that did not drown the unmistakable voices of Black Mambazo. “The song seeks to inspire people to keep moving and never lose focus despite whatever challenges they may encounter in life. 2023 is going to be exciting as it’ll see us release our second album titled, ‘In The Presence 11 – God’s Grace’. We’re grateful for the support that we’re receiving from our fans and it encourages us to keep working hard,” Mlalazi said. <img class="wp-image-616009 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Roil Bulawayo Arts Award The fast-rising gospel artiste dedicated his RoilBAA to the people of Bulawayo for the support that they have been giving him in his music journey. “I’m very humbled to have won the award and I want to thank the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards team for the nomination and people from Bulawayo for their support.
