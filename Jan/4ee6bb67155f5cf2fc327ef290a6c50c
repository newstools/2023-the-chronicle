The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Reporter THE rains which have been pounding  most parts of the country have revived hope for a good harvest in Matabeleland, with agricultural experts urging farmers to focus more on drought-resistant small grains. Since the onset of the 2022/2023 farming season, some districts have received low rainfall which has left farmers who planted maize in a dilemma. In Matabeleland South, Beitbridge and Gwanda districts have been receiving erratic rainfall, with farmers highly likely to miss targets as their maize was beginning to suffer moisture stress. Last year, the Meteorological Service Department (MSD) predicted an above-normal rainfall forecast, but erratic rains in most parts of the region created a gloomy picture for farmers. However, the past week has been characterised by heavy downpours in different parts of the country, including the Matabeleland region.  In an interview, the acting provincial director of agricultural rural development and advisory services in Matabeleland South Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu said the recent rains raised hope for farmers in the semi-arid region. “In Matabeleland South, we are happy because, in the last few days, we received rains except in Gwanda and Beitbridge where the maize crop is in bad state. If it doesn’t rain in the coming weeks, then we will have a serious crisis in the two districts,” he said. “However, we are hopeful because in the past, we have managed to get good harvests from small grains despite erratic rains. I, therefore, urge farmers to continue with these small grains throughout the province.” Mr Ndlovu said farmers should also be on the lookout for pests that are likely to destroy their fields. He said farmers should also be vigilant when applying top-dressing fertiliser in areas where there is too much moisture. <img class="wp-image-632428 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mr-Mkhunjulelwa-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mr-Mkhunjulelwa-Ndlovu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mr-Mkhunjulelwa-Ndlovu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu Matabeleland North chief provincial Agritex officer Mr Dumisani Nyoni said as rains continue falling at different intervals in different areas, there is hope of a good harvest, particularly for farmers who adopted the Pfumvudza/Intwasa method as it requires less water. He said some crops are almost ready for harvesting while others require a few more weeks to mature as a result of the erratic rainfall patterns. “We started receiving rains in mid-November, but this time it would fall in different areas at different times. This saw other farmers planting their grains before others, and this explains why our plants are in different growth stages,” said Mr Ndlovu. “However, we have noted that those who planted last may face challenges if we do not receive rains in the next few days although we remain hopeful. We have also noted that those who used the Intwasa method are unlikely to suffer as they managed to retain moisture through mulching.” Mr Nyoni urged farmers to continue planting grains despite the erratic rainfall patterns, saying there is still a chance to get good yields. He said from the targeted 115 969 hectares of maize, farmers have managed to cover 112 548 hectares in the province. “In terms of small grains, we had a target of 59 569 ha and so far we have managed to cover 42 414ha. For wheat, we targeted 69 821ha and our farmers have planted on about 48 529ha,” said Mr Nyoni. “We are happy that we almost met our sunflower and cotton targets this season whose hectarage stands at 1 768 and 6 047. Farmers should be vigilant when cultivating their fields so that weeds do not affect their crops.” Mr Nyoni warned farmers to be on the lookout for the fall armyworm and the African armyworm which can destroy their crops. “Farmers should also ensure that their livestock is secured so that they do not lose valuable crops as these insects can easily eat everything.” Zimbabwe Farmers Union executive director Mr Paul Zakariya said they are hopeful of recording harvests both in the southern and northern regions given the prevailing rainfall patterns. <img class="wp-image-640589 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-13-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-13-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-13-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Paul Zakariya He noted that while farmers in the southern region experienced dry spells, which affected some crops, all hope was not lost since they received some rains over the past few days. “We are still in the middle of the rainy season and we should understand that what is happening is very normal. Although some parts in the southern region were affected by the prolonged dry spells, we are happy because the available moisture is enough to bring our crops to maturity,” said Mr Zakariya “In Zimbabwe, we are so blessed to have a robust and effective agricultural extension system where in every ward you can be guaranteed that there are at least three extension officers. Farmers should approach them for the appropriate technical advice.” A farmer from Figtree in Bulilima District, Ms Sibonisiwe Moyo said the recent downpour will help her achieve her target; harvesting a tonne of maize. “Hopefully, it will continue raining because we were beginning to lose hope, but over the past few days, our hope has been revived. Things were gloomy and we could easily predict that our crops were a write-off,” she said. “We are grateful for the rains received and we pray that it continues like this so that we get good harvests.” Another local farmer, Ms Helen Mabhiza said the dry spells experienced in November and December had disturbed her maize crop. “I know that I will be getting more than one tonne of maize if this rain continues despite the erratic patterns. We are also having challenges    with pests and I am not sure if we will be able to get enough pesticides so that we do not labour in vain.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-464491 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/msd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/msd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/msd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The MSD has predicted that starting today until Sunday, the southern region will experience reduced rainfall activity. “Members of the public should watch out for a possible dry spell as a result of a moderate tropical storm in Mozambique, which may start diverting moisture away from Zimbabwe. This will result in reduced rainfall activity in the southern region from Thursday until the weekend,” said MSD. In a statement, MSD also urged farmers to closely manage weed and apply fertiliser and pesticides among other activities. – @thamamoe
