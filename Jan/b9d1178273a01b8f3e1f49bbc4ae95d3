HARARE giants Dynamos Football Club will in the coming season have at least seven players who have their football roots in Bulawayo after they officially announced the capture of Bulawayo Chiefs midfielder Arthur “Diego” Musiyiwa. His arrival was announced together with that of Tendai Matindife (21) who was at Ngezi Platinum last year. Musiyiwa, just like Matindife also signed a two- year deal with DeMbare, with both putting pen to paper last Friday. The club while announcing Musiyiwa’s arrival, revealed he will be donning the number 28 jersey. Musiyiwa joins Brandon Mpofu, Shadreck Nyahwa, Junior Makunike, Tinashe Makanda as well as the Moyo twins Kevin and Elvis Moyo whose careers started in Bulawayo. The Moyo twins are said to have been eager to end their football careers where it all started, at Highlanders but Amahlolanyama were not interested in the pair which turns 30 in March.  Dynamos have been poaching in Bulawayo in the past seasons with Bulawayo Chiefs being their hunting ground. Only Manukunike and Makanda are the only players from Bulawayo that DeMbare did not acquire from the financially troubled Amakhosi Amahle. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-431688" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Dynamos-Logo-W-680x342.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="342" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Dynamos-Logo-W.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Dynamos-Logo-W-360x181.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nyasha Chintuli has also joined the Glamour Boys from Manica Diamonds while Dynamos are also eyeing Jayden Barake who was with the relegated Whawha but the young striker reportedly signed a contract with Highlanders last year, which makes him a Bosso player. Dynamos are this week set to embark on a two weeks training camp outside the capital. The Glamour Boys were one of the few Premier Soccer League clubs that started their pre-season training sessions early this year. “This week we will establish a two-week training camp outside Harare. At the end of last week, the technical team was set to give us the final list of players that we are going to take for the camp. Every year, everything relates to our operational budget before the commencement of the league. As such everything is under control. We want to make sure that when the 2023 season starts the team will be ready to compete,” said Dynamos chief executive officer Jonathan Mashingaidze. Dynamos wanted to prepare for the 2023 season by taking part in an invitational tournament organised by Nyasa Big Bullets in Blantyre, Malawi but reports emanating from the neighbouring country indicate that they will not be able to do so due to the suspension handed down by Fifa on Zimbabwe in February last year. <img class="wp-image-673176 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/uijhhjkmgcyu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/uijhhjkmgcyu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/uijhhjkmgcyu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tendai Matindife Last season, Dynamos, who will now be under the tutelage of ex Black Rhinos mentor Herbert ‘Jompano’ Maruwa who replaced Tonderai Ndiraya, finished their campaign on position three with 58 points from 34 matches, 17 points behind champions FC Platinum. Former Dynamos coach Lloyd “MaBlanyo” Chigowe will be part of the Maruwa-led technical department together with Genesis Mangombe and ex captain Murape Murape.
