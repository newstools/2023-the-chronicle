The Chronicle Genesis 3 vs 15
“And i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head and you will strike his heel” NIV Certain Christians have a tendency of magnifying the potential of the devil to destroy their lives. We give him too much credit and honour and that is erroneous. The devil has no power when we resist him. We as Christians have the power to send the devil running and quivering in his boots. <img class="size-large wp-image-603235" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible- Image taken from Shutterstock When you stand and pray, pray that there may by earthquakes in the kingdom of the devil and let every demon run in confusion in every direction. They should run from their assigned positions and not return. Roar like a lion and send the devil on a run, send shock waves to his nerves and let him run back into hiding.  Have a God given message for your generation. Prepare through fasting and prayer a message that will leave people holding on to their chairs in amazement and shock that God can use anyone. If you deliver your message through the Word and deeds, people all over the world will definitely come to Christ. Populate heaven with souls and depopulate hell. Do not be merciful with the devil, treat him very ruthlessly. Wherever you go, have a message for your nation, city, village and family.
Leave your mark
Refuse to just die without leaving a legacy, but strive to be distinguished like Deborah and Esther. Do not pass away from life like a housefly, it leaves no desirable mark but noise and an outbreak of disease. You are empowered to witness if you avail yourself before the presence of God. The Samaritan woman left a mark in history although she was unnamed. You must not die a nobody, but you must leave your footprints in history. Our Saviour’s grace, seen in this woman in John 4 of Samaria illustrates how past actions, beliefs, practices and exposures do not destroy the potential of a person.
Luke 10:19 “Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you”
