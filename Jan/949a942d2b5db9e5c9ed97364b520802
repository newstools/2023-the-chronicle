A true nation-builder, the late former Vice President belonged to the rare breed of our freedom fighters who believed in the power of the people to determine their destiny, in accordance with today’s mantra of building the nation brick by brick, stone upon stone and leaving no one and no place behind,” said Dr Sibanda. He implored citizens to emulate Cde Nkomo as the nation heads towards the harmonised elections. “As the leadership of the Second Republic preaches peace and harmony ahead of the 2023 harmonised elections, we are all reminded that ‘peace begins with me, peace begins with you’, and ‘peace begins with us all’,” said Dr Sibanda. “May the soul of the late former Vice President Cde Landa John Nkomo continue to rest in eternal peace. Long live our Unity, Peace and freedom! Long Live Zimbabwe!”  Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Richard Moyo said Cde Nkomo was passionate about unity and reconciliation. He said the late nationalist worked to come up with a mechanism to promote national healing and tolerance in the country. “The late Vice President Landa John Nkomo was our leader who played a critical role in the development of the country and in fostering unity. He was also instrumental in the signing of the December 22 unity Accord between Zanu-PF and PF- Zapu,” said Minister Moyo. Minister Moyo said Cde Nkomo was a unifier.
“He was humble but concerned about progress, unity and development. As Matabeleland North, we urge youths to emulate the late nationalist and follow in his footsteps,” he said. Minister Moyo said a legacy of reconciliation, national healing and tolerance for which Cde Nkomo worked tirelessly to promote in the country is what he will be remembered for. <img class="size-large wp-image-653886" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-9-13-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-9-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-9-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland North Provincial Affairs Minister Richard Moyo, Cde Nkomo was buried at the National Heroes’ Acre in Harare.

He was a teacher, trade unionist, liberator and politician. He distinguished himself as a committed patriot, civil servant and peacemaker since the earliest nationalist parties of the 1950s and 1960s, right through to the more confrontational phase of the independence struggle of the 1970s and post-independence. The late Vice President was a dedicated revolutionary for the liberation of the country, while in Zimbabwe and in Zambia where he served as the Secretary of Administration for PF-Zapu. He played a pivotal role during the Lancaster House Conference that culminated in the independence of the country and dedicated his life to serving the country before and after independence. <img class="size-large wp-image-446620" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Bulawayo-Provincial-Heroes’-Acre-in-Nkulumane-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Bulawayo-Provincial-Heroes’-Acre-in-Nkulumane.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Bulawayo-Provincial-Heroes’-Acre-in-Nkulumane-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Heroes’ Acre Cde Nkomo was born in the then Gwai Reserve (present-day Tsholotsho) District of Matabeleland North Province on August 22, 1934.
