KWEKWE Residents and Ratepayers Development Association (KKRRDA) has said council should withdraw the 2023 budget it submitted to the Minister of Local Government and Public Works Cde July Moyo for approval. The association says the budget which seeks to raise rates and service charges by almost 300 percent is not what was agreed during budget consultation meetings between council and residents. It said if council does not withdraw the proposed budget, it will be left with no option but to mobilise residents to demonstrate against the local authority.  The proposed budget will result in residents paying an average of US$43 a month in rates and service charges per household, up from US$11. The association says most residents will not be able to pay such an amount hence it is calling on the council to withdraw the budget and revise it downwards. The association says the budget which was submitted to Government for approval was rejected by councillors. <img class="wp-image-612130 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Budget.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Budget.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Budget-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: iStockphoto Addressing journalists in the mining town recently, KKRRDA Chairperson Mr Alex Mwafumbika said council has up to 10 January to withdraw the proposed budget. “The residents called for a standstill budget during the budget consultation meetings and we were therefore shocked to learn that council submitted what we rejected,” said Mr Mwafumbika. He said the increases that council is proposing were not affordable to the majority of residents. “Everyone agrees that we are facing economic challenges hence we proposed that we maintain the 2022 budget. People are already failing to settle the 2022 rates and the situation will be worse with the proposed increases,” said Mr Mwafumbika. <img class="wp-image-659681 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-12-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-12-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-12-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kwekwe City Council offices He said one household recently received a ZW$420 000 water bill. “We have one resident who received a water bill of about $420 000. Surely where do we expect that person to get that kind of money?  This is even before the proposed increases,” said Mr Mwafumbika. He said it defeats logic for council to consult residents and other ratepayers on the budget and then ignore their inputs. <img class="wp-image-637315 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-80.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-80.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-80-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Mwafumbika said the association was worried about the council’s misplaced priorities like buying expensive cars for council employees at a time when the local authority is failing to provide essential services to residents. “Council spent about US$90 million on luxury vehicles when it is failing to provide services. If these issues are not addressed by January 10, we are staging a demonstration,” he said.
Mr Mwafumbika said the newly formed KKRRDA was there to defend the rights of the ratepayers.
