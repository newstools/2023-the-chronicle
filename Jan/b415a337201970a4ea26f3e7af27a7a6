The Chronicle IN a move that will greatly enhance customer convenience and user flexibility, EcoCash has extended the validity period of its virtual MasterCard from 28 days to 365 days (1 year). A virtual card is a digital debit card that is generated from a customers’ EcoCash USD wallet and is used to make online payments. “We have fantastic news for all EcoCash subscribers! They can now generate a virtual MasterCard directly off their EcoCash USD wallet to facilitate all online payments from as little as US$0.50. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-511169" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/mastercard-680x380.gif" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/mastercard-680x380.gif 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/mastercard-360x200.gif 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “By dialling *153*6#, or by launching their EcoCash App, EcoCash customers can instantly generate an EcoCash virtual MasterCard, which is now valid for 365 days (1 year),” said EcoCash chief operating officer Mr Munyaradzi Nhamo in a message to customers. “All card details, such as the card number, CVV and card expiry dates are sent to the customer via SMS. With the EcoCash virtual Mastercard one can make instant online payments such as paying for their DStv subscription, Netflix, Alibaba, Spotify, Avon or any other international online payments,” said Mr Nhamo.  The EcoCash virtual MasterCard addresses the growing demand for convenient digital, contactless commercial payments, which has been amplified by the changing nature of work and business after the Covid-19 pandemic, and the rise of the work-from-home economy. Previously, one of the main barriers to wider adoption of virtual cards has been the inability to load them onto a mobile wallet for use at physical point-of-sale terminals. But with the new solution, individuals and businesses can load their virtual card onto their mobile wallet to easily initiate contactless payments using their mobile device.
Mr Nhamo said customers will also be able to cash-in funds onto their card at no additional cost at any EcoCash Channel Agents, including Econet shops throughout the country. “The balance on the customer’s EcoCash USD wallet mirrors the balance on the customers EcoCash virtual MasterCard,” he said. He explained that the virtual card has different details to one’s physical card, and has flexible card management tools accessible via the EcoCash App or EcoCash USSD menu. “That means it’s safe, secure, smart and simple way to make payments no matter where you are in the world,” he said.
