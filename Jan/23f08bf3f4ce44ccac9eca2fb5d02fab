The Chronicle Brandon Moyo FOR the hundreds of people who attended the Munch & Sip food festival last month, one thing that they can agree on is the talent possessed by one DJ Sibbs Apollo (real name Kudzai Sibanda). For the better part of the evening on December 30 at the Criterion Park in Burnside, crowds could be heard chanting “Apollo, we wanna party,” as they cheered the DJ on. So vibrant was his set that it caused a power outage on stage for a moment. Those familiar with Chuck Roberts’ “My House” will know the phrase “music is a universal language spoken and understood by all” and that indirectly was inspiration enough for Sibbs Apollo who has found pleasure in making people happy. <img class="alignnone wp-image-672192 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-21-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-21-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-21-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  DJ Sibbs Apollo Standing out and being unique is important if you wish to make it in any field. Mastering a universal language and coming up with his unique style, DJ Sibbs Apollo has received a warm welcome from Bulawayo. “Music to me has always been a universal language in which different cultures connect in rhythm and navigate the world better with its challenges. Such was the case with me when I started my career as a DJ and events host in 2016. Seeing people dance, connect and let loose for me has been the best reward.  “The industry itself has been very welcoming of my style of play and entertainment structure. It is unique in the sense that I have not seen anyone that does things the way I do and the people seem to love and want more of it,” he said. The main purpose of anyone behind the decks is to keep people up on their feet all the time and for Sibbs Apollo, that was one skill that he learnt at a young age. For him, music is not a passion but a purpose, as it is something that is a part of him. “When I was young, I’d always somehow be the one responsible for house parties at home and in my area as I understood the concept of keeping people on the dance floor with my heavy-hitting playlists and song selection. I always had my hand on the pulse with the latest sounds and trends,” he said. At last year’s Zim Hip Hop Awards, the DJ was nominated for best club and event DJ and he believes the one song that put him in the spotlight was the remix he produced of the hit song ` where he featured Indigo Saint, Luminous and Boy Nino. Many people who follow him will definitely know of a remix series he has been running where he mixes local sounds with international sounds, bringing new life to the songs. <img class="alignnone wp-image-672195 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-20-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Sibbs Apollo Cooperation is key to success and DJ Sibbs has been working with many hip-hop artists from the city, including, arguably the biggest movement, the Hip Hop Power Sessions, which has fostered relationships and connections with most of the industry captains. Liking to keep a low profile and giving surprises, Apollo encouraged fans to watch the space! “More shows! More fire! More Fun!” he said. – @brandon_malvin
