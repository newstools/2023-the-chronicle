The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent AN armed robber who is part of a notorious two-men gang was not so lucky when he was apprehended by one of his victims and handed over to the police. The brave victim clung to the gangster like a limpet and would not let go even when the robber stabbed him multiple times, until other residents woke up and apprehended him. Khulani Dube (22) and his partner, Palma Nyirongo who is still on the run, had broken into two houses in Mbizo 12, and Mbizo 16 when their luck ran out as they intended to break into the third house. Despite having been stabbed Costen Mundenguma clung to Dube and called for help from the neighbours who helped in effecting a citizen’s arrest. Midlands Police Spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the incident. “One member of a two-man gang of robbers was arrested following an armed robbery spree in which they broke into three houses in Kwekwe in one night,” said Inspector Mahoko. On the night, the two are reported to have broken down a door using machetes before stealing books and cellphones. In the second house, they stole cash and cellphones. They entered Mundenguma’s homestead in Mbizo 10, switched off lights and lit their torches. “Mundenguma was awakened by the noise and he confronted the suspects who retaliated and stabbed him with a knife all over the body. Mundenguma however managed to grab Dube by the neck while shouting for help. Neighbours came out in their numbers and helped apprehend Dube. His accomplice Nyirongo managed to escape,” said Insp Mahoko. “Following their arrest, stolen property valued at US$310 was recovered. This includes a satchel containing property and cellphones stolen from the previous break ins. Weapons like machetes, knives and an axe were also recovered,” said Insp Mahoko. He appealed for information that could lead to Nyirongo’s arrest, saying anyone who could assist should visit their nearest police station.
