The trip saw the group of students visiting a studio n Chinotimba suburb where Rulator had a feel of the recording processes. “I saw her last year when I was invited at Chibila Secondary School for a cultural expo. Their school Chipale was invited and she performed. I liked her poetry because she recite poems in Tonga and as an artist I have a soft spot for indigenous poets especially Tonga. So I want to promote her hence i took her to the studio where she will record her poetry,” said Dube. <img class="wp-image-676862 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-3-20-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-3-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-3-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chipale Secondary School Culture Club members during a visiting to Victoria Falls He said he has identified four budding who he wants to help if resources permit.

Mudenda said Rulator is a confident girl who as a young Form One girl would lead in singing at the school assembly. “We started the group as a school to specialize in poetry and arts performance in the year 2017. When Rulator Ndlovu came for Form One I saw a small girl who was very comfortable with anything and could sing at the assembly when everyone couldn’t. “I invited her to join our group soon after we returned from the National AIDS Council school quiz competition and I observed she is multi-talented as she can also dance. We met Obert Dube at a function organised by our neighboring school and she showed so much confidence to win the hearts of many people and Dube who was the guest speaker was touched and offered to promote her,” said Mudenda. -@ncubeleon
