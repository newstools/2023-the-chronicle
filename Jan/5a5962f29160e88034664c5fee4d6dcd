The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE impressive work ethic displayed by Zimbabwean striker Lucky Mkosana has seen him being rewarded with a contract by United States of America second tier club Tampa Bay Rowdies. According to online reports, Mkosana surpassed 100 appearances in his career for the Rowdies last season and ranks sixth for the club in modern-era appearances with 105 matches played. Rowdies coach Neil Collins marvelled at Mkosana’s work ethic adding that the forward “trained fantastically and hardly missed a day”.  The gaffer said: “At times I didn’t give Lucky the opportunity he deserved last year based on how he trained. Age is just a number. He can still make an impact on and off the field. I don’t think there’s anyone better at impacting the game off the bench. He showed that when the chances come, he invariably puts them in the net. Just getting those chances is a big part of his game. “We’re delighted to have him back. With more turnover than we’ve had in the past, it’s important to have guys that show the players coming in what the standards are and what it means to play for this club.” <img class="size-large wp-image-621925" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-8-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-57-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lucky Mkosana The Plumtree-bred footie star, who is in his second stint at the club, said he elated with the new contract. The former Warriors striker first joined Rowdies on loan from the Harrisburg City Islanders in 2013 and left at the end of 2014 season to join New York Cosmos. Mkosana returned to the Rowdies in 2019. “It’s hard to put into words what it means to play for the Rowdies. For me, coming in for my seventh year, we still need that third star and that’s something still to play for. The connection with the community, the fans, and how family-oriented it is. Everyone is together and you get that atmosphere when you’re playing that everyone is really here to support you. There’s nothing that compares to playing here at Al Lang,” said Mkosana. — @ZililoR
