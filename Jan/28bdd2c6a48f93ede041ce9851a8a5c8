FIRST Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa’s hand has been visible in efforts to ensure members of the previously marginalised Doma community in Kanyemba attend school, among other life-changing empowerment programmes she has initiated. Previously, community members did not attend school owing to a number of factors, including the unavailability of schools.
Each time she visits the area, the First Lady spends a week or longer staying with the people while listening to their concerns and finding ways to address them. Some of the learners had their fees and consumables paid for by the First Lady through her Angel of Hope Foundation which is touching lives throughout the country. Even the President recently commended the First Lady saying her travels were influencing development in the areas she visits.  “Wherever she goes people form clubs and carry forward the programmes she would have initiated. She would go to Kanyemba and come to share with me what she would have encountered and plead with me to look into the areas she would have highlighted. When she first went to Kanyemba, she told me lots of stories and I quickly sent my ministers to look into the issues. “I am happy to announce that there are good roads connecting to Kanyemba. We are building schools and clinics there. We agreed to make it a smart city. All this is through the First Lady’s hard work,” the President said during a congratulatory party for the First Lady in Zvishavane. Prior to the First Lady’s intervention, learners in Kanyemba lagged behind in education as they could neither read nor write, but now some of them have progressed to do Form One at Chapoto Secondary School. What compounded their challenges was the absence of schools in their community and learning materials, something which Dr Mnangagwa has been addressing. Mr Partson Chitoro, the head of Mariga Primary School gave a glimpse of the journey travelled so far with the assistance of the First Lady. <img class="size-large wp-image-677109" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wddg-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wddg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/wddg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A teacher writes on a black board, one of the several donated by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa in 2018 as he demonstrates how he is going to teach learners in the Doma community who were used to writing on the ground “I wish to thank the First Lady for helping us in having a school after a long time without a school for the Doma community. We started with learners from ECD A to Grade Three. I am grateful that we now have learners who completed Grade Seven last year with the assistance of the First Lady who was paying their fees through her Angel of Hope Foundation. “These children were supported with everything including books and uniforms. The children performed very well that out of 35 primary schools that we have in Mbire District, they came out eighth even though it was their first time to write Grade Seven examinations. I am also thankful for the projects that she undertakes here,” Mr Chitoro said. The headmaster of Chapoto Secondary School, Mr Cosmas Guvheya, echoed similar sentiments and paid tribute to the First Lady for her life-changing interventions. Members of the Doma community of Mariga under Chief Chapoto, Mr Guvheya said, were primitive for a long time as they were not receiving any education due to a number of factors. He said the children could not attend a school which is far away in another comnunity and they risked life and limb crossing a flooded river and encountering wildlife. <img class="size-large wp-image-677113" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fgdfgd-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fgdfgd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fgdfgd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Schoolchildren in Kanyemba carry books which were donated by First Lady Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa through her Angel of Hope Foundation.

There was remarkable change when Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa constantly visited the community. She observed that Mariga Community needed a school so that the aged children would attend school. Since the people were lagging behind in civilisation, the First Lady noted that the essence of education was key,” he said. Amai Mnangagwa, who has a passion for the empowerment of communities through education as evidenced by her schools feeding programme and partnership with Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) which is offering courses to citizens countrywide for free, regularly visits the area and spends close to a week there while undertaking various developmental programmes.
She advocated the opening of Mariga Primary School to motivate and empower the people through education. “The school was opened by erecting Early Childhood Development (ECD) class which comprised all age groups and some of the learners were married. The aim was for them to be able to read and write. The move was done in the year 2018. The ECD voluntary teachers were a couple who were getting incentives from the First Lady herself. Learners on the Mariga side of Mwazamutanda then benefitted by enrolling at Mariga Primary school. On her several visits to the community, the First Lady would bring reading books, stationery and many other learning resources. Learners would be furnished with clothing and uniforms. Most importantly Dr Mnangagwa at some point through her foundation paid school levies for the whole school and she influenced the construction of classroom blocks at Mariga Primary school,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-468053" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Zimbabwe-Open-University--680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Zimbabwe-Open-University-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Zimbabwe-Open-University--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The school was adorned with a fish pond and an orchard all being provided by the First Lady. There is significant progress, education wise, with those who wrote Grade Seven last year performing averagely.
With their ages, there were suggestions that the learners be put in vocational training centres to acquire life skills. “The learners are over-aged with the youngest at 18 years and some have families at home, but they are only in Form One. The head teacher and the school governing body were of the opinion that the learners be enrolled at the Vocational Training Centres to attain education with and for production. They are now able to read and write, thus they can manage to learn. “Furthermore, the Doma community especially the school going age ,are now concentrating on schooling and the elders are now focused on education as well through the help of our mother. Amai Mnangagwa did not concentrate on Mariga community alone, she extended her focus to Chapoto primary school as well as Chapoto Secondary School,” Mr Guvheya said. On her visit to Kanyemba in 2018, the First Lady selected learners who had excelled at Chapoto primary school and took them through to Form Four while catering for their fees.
At the secondary school, she proposed for a low cost boarding facility to cater for Mariga learners due to the flooding river and wildlife barriers. The first Lady sourced building materials and construction is underway.
The school benefitted learning resources in the form of textbooks and stationery. Across Kanyemba, the First Lady has conducted a number of educational activities and introduced the Nhanga/Gota/Ixhiba programme to reduce early marriages. She also runs a school feeding programme under which she provides foodstuffs to the schools to ensure no one pulls out of school because of food challenges and to boost the attendance rate. “Above all, there is remarkable change in literacy and livelihood of the Doma people and the people of Kanyemba at large. Besides departmental and ministerial development which were paved way by Amai’s constant visits to Kanyemba, the people are now able to read and write. The Mariga people are now confident as they are seen on market places selling different farm and garden produce and being to manage their finances. Some members of the community are now able to write notes during community meetings and contributing effectively.” Learners showered the First Lady with praises for her love and kindness that set them on a path to success.
Emsen Chaukura said he was grateful he no longer has to travel across the river to school. “I wish to thank the First Lady for everything she has done for us as the Doma community. We were failing to travel across the river and wild animals affected us. The First Lady gave us all we needed an I now can read and write and am now in Form One at 20 years of age,” he said with a smile. Similar views were shared by Irvine Nyamhandu (19).
“I humble myself because of what the First Lady did for me. I just do not know how best I can thank her. In my family I am the only child who can read and write. I can now count money and write letters. All this was achieved through the First Lady’s assistance and I am now in Form One. We are grateful Amai, we are here today because of your love and kindness,” he said. Hilda Juankim could not hide her joy at being allowed to attend school.
She said if it was not for the First Lady, she would have been married at a young age. “I am thankful to Amai for taking me through school from Form One up to Form Four. She would provide all I needed on time and were it not for her, I would by now be married. Her love is unmatched,” she said.
