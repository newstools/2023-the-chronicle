The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter WEEKS after verbally agreeing terms to retrace to Castle Lager Premier Soccer League returnees Hwange, coach Bongani Mafu yesterday signed a two-year contract with the coalminers to officially reunite with his former paymasters. The former Highlanders and Zimbabwe Saints head coach left Chipangano in March 2022 for Ngezi Platinum Stars in a development that saw the coal miners appoint Try Ncube as their substantive coach. <img class="size-large wp-image-648121" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Hwange-Football-Club-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Hwange-Football-Club-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Hwange-Football-Club-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange Football Club Mafu had joined Mhondoro based Ngezi Platinum Stars as assistant coach to former Warriors striker and captain Benjani Mwaruwari before the two were sacked in July. After joining the club in August, Ncube went on to lead Hwange back into the topflight league ending their three-year absence from the country’s elite football league. Before Ncube’s appointment the club was under the tutelage of Edmore Sibanda and Chipangano legend Obert “Cobra” Moyo. Ncube, a former Bulawayo City head coach, was in charge of six games. He won five and drew one to help Hwange earn top flight promotion with a game to spare after beating Indlovu Iyanyathela 1-0 in October last year. <img class="size-large wp-image-649228" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-7-copy-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-7-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-7-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Try Ncube “Everything is now sorted but I can’t comment any further. I refer all questions to club administrator Khumbulani Mbano,” said a seemingly ecstatic Mafu moments after putting pen to paper and meeting the club’s executive. While Mbano was not immediately available for a comment as he was not reachable on his mobile phone, impeccable sources within the Chipangano camp confirmed that Mafu and the club had sealed a two year deal.  Hwange were relegated from the domestic premiership in 2019 after finishing 17th on the log before the 2020 season never took off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Hwange, who boasted of the services of seasoned trio that included former Highlanders and Chicken Inn captain Felix Chindungwe, combative Thabani Goredema, pacy midfielder Canaan Nkomo earned and ex Bosso goal minder Nedrick Madeya, won the 2022 Zifa Southern Region Division One League to earn a ticket back to the top league earned promotion to join Simba Bhora (Northern Region), Green Fuel (Eastern Region), and Sheasham (Central Region).
Hwange will start their pre-season training today at the Colliery Stadium under the watchful eye of Mafu. – @FungaiMuderere
