The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Chiefs Football Club players said the leadership was not being honest by claiming it was working on paying them outstanding salaries. The Amakhosi Amahle leadership which has not paid players for several months, took to social media to announce they are working behind the scenes to resolve the impasse but the players have dismissed this. They said there is nothing happening and they believe no change will come at this preparatory stage of the 2023 season, which interestingly starts next month with Chiefs as the Chibuku Super Cup winners facing league champions FC Platinum in the Castle Challenge Cup. “Behind the Scenes EFFORTS still qualify to be respected as EFFORTS,” the club posted on its Facebook on Wednesday.
The team’s attacking midfielder Perfect Chikwende, who is heavily linked with a move to FC Platinum or Ngezi Platinum Stars, was the first to react to the post.  “Munhu anyora izvi ane zvivindi chaizvo” which loosely translates to “The person who posted this has guts” wrote Chikwende.
Arthur Musiyiwa, who is being sought after by Highlanders responded and said: <img class="size-large wp-image-653146" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/saxaszx-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/saxaszx.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/saxaszx-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Perfect Chikwende at Luveve Stadium “Akaguta iye ne mhuri yake isusu tine nzara but Mwari hadhakwe” which translates to “He and his family have enough to eat while we are hungry but God never gets drunk.” Another senior player, Kelvin Madzongwe couild not be left out and he said: “The insensitivity and disrespect they’ve shown is immeasurable .ukudelela kwakhona so. Abasenzi bantu.” <img class="size-large wp-image-659087" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/dfmnhjmhjmjm-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/dfmnhjmhjmjm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/dfmnhjmhjmjm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kevin Madzongwe The Chibuku Super Cup winners last paid their players in June.
A fortnight ago, placards were left at the Chiefs shop which is at Tshaka Centre reportedly by disgruntled players who said they endured a miserable Christmas. The players said they have nothing to show for winning the Chibuku Super Cup and finishing seventh, the best ever position achieved by the club since its entry into the PSL in 2018. Chiefs had, in terms of an agreement brokered by the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe, undertaken to surrender 70 percent of the US$75 000 they got for winning the Chibuku Super Cup and 100 percent of the seventh place prize money from the PSL to settle the arrears. It appears they have not stuck to that agreement hence many players including those still contracted want to leave the club.
