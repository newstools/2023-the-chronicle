The Chronicle    Thokozile Mbedzi, Chronicle Reporter IT took 13 years, but it was worth the wait! The Methodist Church at Sigola Village ended 2022 in style by completing a church building, whose foundation stone was set in 2009.  <img class="wp-image-672735 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-30-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-30-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-30-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Presiding Bishop Reverend George Mawire with Gogo Alice Sibanda (Centre) one of the pioneers of the church Despite numerous setbacks, church members in the Wesley circuit persevered as they believed God was actually building the house of worship. <img class="wp-image-672725 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-25-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-25-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-25-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Waiting for official opening of the Church They put their faith in Psalm 127:1 which reads: “except the LORD builds a house, the laborers will be building in vain.” Before completing the church, congregants used to worship at a chapel in Induna Barracks. <img class="wp-image-672738 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-31-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-31-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-31-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Congregants inside the church This had drawbacks because the barrack is a security area with restrictions and most members in the army would get transferred, forcing the church to continually rebuild membership.

It was, therefore, with great pomp and fanfare that Presiding Bishop Reverend George T Mawire officially commissioned the completed building on October 30, 2022.
