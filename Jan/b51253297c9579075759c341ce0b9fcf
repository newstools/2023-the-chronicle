ZIMBABWEAN all-rounder, Ryan Burl has had a stellar performance for his team, Kathmandu Knights in the Nepal T20 league where he scored an unbeaten half century to guide the side to a third win of the season, victory by 90 runs against Janakpur Royals on New Year’s Day at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. The 28-year old Burl, coming in to bat at number five in their first match of the new year hammered a 40 ball 61 runs not out to help his team finish on 180-6. The big hitting all-rounder’s innings consisted of four fours and three sixes. His 61 runs were however, not the highest of the team’s innings with Nepal born opening batsman Sunam Gautam top scoring with one run more than the Zimbabwean on 62 runs off 47 deliveries.  Not having a dance with the ball, Burl’s team Kathmandu Knights managed to bowl out the Royals for 90 runs and make it three wins out of six matches. However, the huge victory was followed by a five wickets defeat at the hands of Pokhara Avengers on Monday. Burl scored an unbeaten 10 runs off five deliveries as his side finished on 164-4 in their 20 overs. England international Alex Blake top scored with 64 runs off 28 balls. Taking two catches in their defence, Burl and his Knights side could not restrict their opponents who crossed the line with two balls to spare in the match finishing on 168-5. <img class="wp-image-643157 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-39a.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-39a.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-39a-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ryan Burl in action Burl, who is set to join Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) side Sylhet Strikers missed out on the team’s latest match which was played yesterday where they won by 34 runs against Sikandar Raza’s Biratnagar Super Kings.
