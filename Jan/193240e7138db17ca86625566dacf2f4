The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma in Masvingo THE Ministry of Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services and the telecommunications regulator Potraz have opened avenues to help fulfill President Mnangagwa’s call to youths to step up ICT usage. Addressing thousands of youths at the Robert Mugabe Square during the National Youth Day last year, President Mnangagwa said the youths must step up ICT usage to explore and exploit business opportunities across various sectors. President Mnangagwa also challenged young people to be actively involved technologically and be part of broad-based empowerment programmes being rolled out under the Second Republic. To fulfill the call, the ICT Ministry and Potraz opened 12 computer laboratories on Monday in Masvingo. <img class="wp-image-677207 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-30-at-3.49.39-PM.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-30-at-3.49.39-PM.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/WhatsApp-Image-2023-01-30-at-3.49.39-PM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ICT Deputy Minister Dingumuzi Phuti officially commissions Magombedze Secondary School computer Laboratory in Masvingo today.
