The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporters AFTER being appointed juniors coach at Chicken Inn, aging ex Gamecocks defender, Moses Jackson on Wednesday emerged as one of the many veterans trying their luck at Bulawayo Chiefs. Chiefs, who are in their early stages of pre-season training, are now under the guidance of ex Tsholotsho FC and FC Platinum gaffer Lizwe Sweswe who officially started work on Monday. Jackson has since last year been working on acquiring coaching badges together with his former defence partner at Chicken Inn, Guide Goddard. According to sources, Jackson successfully applied for the junior coach job at Chicken Inn. He is deemed as a club legend hence the move to have him help out at the club’s junior structures. Ex-Warriors gaffer Joey Antipas, who has worked with Jackson for over six years at the Simbisa Brands sponsored outfit, is on record saying it was prudent for the Gweru bred footballer to take up other roles at Gamecocks together with Goddard. <img class="wp-image-676156 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bulawayo-Chiefs-training-Moses-Jacksonb-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bulawayo-Chiefs-training-Moses-Jacksonb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bulawayo-Chiefs-training-Moses-Jacksonb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Moses Jackson Jackson, who has attributed his long stay in the game to a combination of discipline and passion for the sport, started training with Bulawayo Chiefs on Wednesday and the club seems keen to rope in other seasoned players that include ex Highlanders duo of Welcome “Waroowa” Ndiweni and goalkeeper Munyaradzi Diya, midfielder Innocent Kutsanzira and goalkeeper Aaron Ngwenya. Also trying his luck with the Twitter Kings is ex Tsholotsho skipper William Stima who recently parted ways with FC Platinum. Stima has over the years enjoyed a good working relationship with Sweswe. Sweswe, who is on record saying he wants to make sure the club remains in the topflight, needs experienced players as he builds a strong team. The new Chiefs coach said he was happy to have these experienced players showing up at training and if they prove to be in good shape, he will not hesitate to rope them into the squad.  “I think everything’s coming up well. It’s been a few days of work with the team and I’m happy to have found everything in order. I took over from people who were doing a fantastic job in conducting trials. New faces have been showing up every day and at this level it is good to have experienced players coming to help out young players. <img class="size-large wp-image-676157" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bulawayo-Chiefs-training-Welcome-Ndiweni-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bulawayo-Chiefs-training-Welcome-Ndiweni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bulawayo-Chiefs-training-Welcome-Ndiweni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Welcome Ndiweni “We need such experienced players who can give the team stability and also give the young ones the much-needed football guidance,” said Sweswe, who is coming from Division One club, Talen Vision.
Asked if he was likely to sign the veteran players, the soft-spoken gaffer said: “It will depend on their shape. If they are in good shape, I see no reason of not roping them into the team.” Some of the players that have left the financially troubled Amakhosi Amahle include the trio of Moyo twins Elvis and Kevin as well as attacking midfielder Arthur Musiyiwa who signed for Dynamos, goalkeeper David Bizabani now with Green Fuel and forward Perfect Chikwende who made a return to FC Platinum. Among players from last season’s squad who are preparing for the Castle Challenge Cup against FC Platinum are skipper Malvin Mkolo, Felix Moyo, Mthokozisi Msebe, Obriel Chirinda, Ben Nyahunzwi, Matripples Muleya and Lexington Mujokoro. This is the base that Sweswe will use to build his squad.
