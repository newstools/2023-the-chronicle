The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Chronicle Reporter NATIONAL Chiefs’ Council president, Fortune Charumbira, has advised those in leadership positions to work closely with the people saying candidates who do not know their roots and identity are not qualified to lead. He was speaking during the recent official installation of the newly-appointed Chief Manguba in Bulilima District, Matabeleland South province. Chief Charumbira was part of a high-powered delegation of traditional leaders who witnessed the event held at Phakama High School. <img class="size-large wp-image-669839" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-1-copy-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-1-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-1-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Manguba In his remarks, he said a leader’s strength and credibility were largely entrenched in one’s cultural identity and heritage. Chief Charumbira expressed disappointment in some of the youths, especially, who have a tendency of denigrating their background saying such personalities must not aspire to be leaders. “There are people who are in Form Four and you ask them where they come from in terms of their rural areas and they don’t know. You’re not worth being a leader anywhere if you don’t have an identity, which traces you to any place in Zimbabwe,” said the chiefs’ president. “Don’t put people in positions of power if they can’t trace where they come from and don’t know their rural area. Whom do you want to lead?”  Chief Charumbira said being a leader is all about being cultured, adding that no matter how educated one can be, a serious leader will not be effective if not grounded on cultural values and norms. “How you lead is not about how educated but to be effective is about your own values and culture. The issue of identity, not knowing who we are as Africans has regressed our growth and development as a continent,” he said. “It’s not enough to be an engineer wherever in the world when you don’t know what you’re saying. You will still be looked down on. “The moment you are proud of your identity, then you have started on the journey to success. As Africans, we aren’t proud of our identity hence we adopt other people’s cultures,” said Chief Charumbira. He said during one of his visits to Europe, he was amazed about how communities there give special regard to culture, an attitude that all Africans must also embrace. <img class="size-large wp-image-640268" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-16-8-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-16-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-16-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Fortune Charumbira “In Europe, there is no country that doesn’t want to be made important, no matter how small they are. I was at the EU relations meeting last week, I didn’t know that those people use 25 languages in their Parliament, all being interpreted. This is because each nation is proud of who they are,” said Chief Charumbira. “Identity gives you the push to work for others. So, what has been done here is commendable, and we should thank you. I’m happy that Chief Gampu agreed to allow part of his jurisdiction to be taken over by Chief Manguba and his people.” He advised Chief Manguba to be a listening leader and to work closely with his subjects in all aspects.
“Ninety-five percent of the time you’ll be listening. Speak less and listen more. As a chief, you don’t make rulings alone. A chief makes decisions in the council, and there’s no chief that sits and presides over cases alone,” he said. “Not only in terms of the constitution or any other law, but in terms of our own culture. You must have a dare/inkundla that is made up of people who will help you come to decisions.”
