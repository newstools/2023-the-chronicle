The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Business Reporter THE Bulawayo City Council (BCC) and the business community are engaged in talks on the possibility of the latter having free leases to manage pavements in front of their shops, an official said.
Council officials and representatives from the business community recently initiated the engagement process. The scoop of discussions centred on how the business community can assist council in maintaining cleanliness amid growing concerns from residents that the city centre is increasingly becoming dirty.
Illegal vendors mostly located on several pavements are partially accused of fueling littering. <img class="wp-image-613147 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council (BCC) Dumped litter that gives off an offensive stench and breeds flies has become synonymous with the streets of Bulawayo, especially in the areas surrounding the market places.
The rainy season has worsened the situation. Concerns have also been raised that littering in the city centre could lead to an outbreak of diseases.
Registered business and informal traders have long called on council to act on the illegal vendors operating within the city centre.
BCC city valuer and City Estates Officer Mr Thabani Ncube said they have held discussions on how the business community can help curb illegal activities. “This engagement with the business community will assist us as council to deal with illegal activities and we implore the business sector to assist us with the issue of littering.
“Where possible you use designated points to dump the litter that is generated by your businesses,” he said.
One of the measures to reduce litter was for businesses to increase the number of bins placed at strategic areas within the city centre.  BCC Divisional Environmental Health Officer Mr Patrick Ncube said business premises can have their own separate refuse collection schedules.
He cited areas within bottle store vicinity as posing major litter challenges for the council. Bulawayo’s central business district sanitary lanes have become a haven of litter with the local authority expressing concern over rampant dumping which has rendered its night garbage collection ineffective.
In November last year, council introduced night refuse collection in a bid to restore the city to its former glory as one of the cleanest in southern Africa.
But since the start of the programme, the city’s streets have remained very dirty as if there is no garbage collection.
