The Chronicle Innocent Kurira , Sports Reporter IT appears Highlanders Football Club have taken no time in trying to fill in the gap left by defensive midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku by trying out Bulawayo City central midfielder Melikhaya Ncube. Masuku joined Jwaneng Galaxy on Tuesday and Ncube has been training with the Bulawayo giants this week.
Though Highlanders are not short of options in central midfield with the likes of Darlington Mukuli, Mason Mushore, Adrian Silla and recently promoted Gillian Nyathi all capable replacements, coach Balmater Brito appears to still need more options in the middle of the park. <img class="wp-image-647063 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-30-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-30-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-30-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Balmater Brito Ncube who has been training with Highlanders, was a key figure for Bulawayo City last season and was
linked with Chicken Inn and Ngezi Platinum during last campaigns mid-season transfer window.
Ncube (25) can assume numerous central roles but is more of a box to box midfielder. If he joins, Brito will most likely look to gradually integrate him into the team.  With the amount of Bulawayo City matches watched by Brito last season, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Portuguese coach is an admirer of the midfielder. Highlanders communications officer Nozibelo Maphosa confirmed that the Bulawayo City captain was training with Amahlolanyama.
“Yes he is training with us. The coaches are looking at him. We will communicate once there is something concrete,” said Maphosa. <img class="wp-image-614112 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso spokesperson Nozibelo Maphosa Bosso’s transfer business is moving at a slow pace with coach Brito indicating there will be outgoings and incomings at the club in the next weeks. Chronicle Sports understands Crispen Ncube, Muziwethu Dlamini and Toto Banda are some of the players on their way out. The club has been quiet on new players but the coaches have said they will be additions to the team.
Brito is on record saying he wants tactically disciplined players who will be able to take instructions and execute their game plan to perfection. -@innocentskizoe
