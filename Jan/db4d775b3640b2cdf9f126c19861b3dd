The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS Football Club has announced forward Muziwakhe Dhlamini will not be part of their squad for the 2023 season. Dhlamini becomes the latest player the club has parted ways with after going separate ways with striker Bukhosi Sibanda and midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku who now plays in Botswana’s topflight league. “Muziwakhe Dhlamini has parted ways with the club on mutual terms. We wish him well in his new endeavours,” the club announced yesterday. Dhlamini’s departure comes not as a surprise after the midfielder failed to cement a place since being recalled from loan at the start of 2020. He was promoted into the first team by Mark Harrison together with Cadwell Gavaza.  In 2019, Dhlamini scored 10 goals in the Southern Region Division One league for Ciwu where he was on loan from Bosso. He was voted into the best eleven of the league that year. Those exploits resulted in Harrison promoting him. Dhlamini joined the Highlanders developmental side Bosso 90 in 2016. That is when his name became popular, as he was an integral member of Bosso 90 side, alongside the likes of Charlton Siamalonga, Vincent Moyo, Smart Daudi, Brian Jaravaza amongst others. He was later loaned out to Ciwu. <img class="size-large wp-image-630334" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-261-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-261.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-261-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso In the 2021/22 season, Dlamini did play some matches for the first team but a long term injury sidelined him for months. Bosso’s transfer business is moving at a low pace with coach Baltemar Brito indicating there will be outgoings and incomings at the club in the next weeks. Chronicle Sports understands Highlanders are also in the process of negotiating the termination of contracts of Crispen Ncube and Toto Banda. Brito is on record saying he wants tactically disciplined players who will be able to take instructions and execute their game plan to perfection. — @innocentskizoe
