Our choice of Dubai is based on its popularity, both as a tourist and financial centre and in our view, it was befitting to add it to our destination as our food distribution centre, not only for the region but other international destinations. “Of particular importance has been the role played by the chamber, Dubai International Chamber has brought strategic partners who will make it easier for Nhimbe to implement this export programme.” <img class="size-large wp-image-669575" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/download-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/download-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/download-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Blueberry Dr Moyo said by providing logistics and funding partners, Dubai International Chamber enables foreign companies such as Nhimbe to leverage Dubai’s extensive land, sea and air logistics to open up new trade routes across the region and beyond. “We anticipate moving 500 000 tonnes of produce into the UAE market through Dubai, some of which will go into supermarkets, wholesale and others as exports from Dubai to neighbouring countries,” said Dr Moyo. “This is expected to create more than US$150 million of exports to Dubai every year, and Dubai itself will earn about US$200 million in exports to other international markets. This win-win situation is Nhimbe’s vision of Dubai as a gateway to international markets.” Nhimbe’s business expansion supports Dubai’s vision to increase foreign trade from AED1,4 trillion to AED2 trillion between 2021 and 2026. — Emirates News Agency.
