THE Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (Zimdef) collected more than $8,1 billion in 2022, the bulk of which was disbursed towards supporting various national development projects. In a statement, Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Minister, Professor Amon Murwira, said Zimdef disbursed the funds last year and was now rebranding its operations to buttress the attainment of the national vision and remaining relevant and accessible to its stakeholders. <img class="size-large wp-image-587939" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Professor-Amon-Murwira-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Professor-Amon-Murwira.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Professor-Amon-Murwira-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation Science and Technology Development Minister, Professor Amon Murwira Zimdef is a statutory body mandated to fund the development of critical and highly skilled human capital in Zimbabwe.
“In 2022 alone, the fund collected more than $8,1 billion, which has been disbursed through the Government for various projects and programs at institutions of higher and tertiary learning throughout the country,” said the minister. “The revenue collected has also benefited apprentices nationwide and it is indeed pleasing to note that many of the nation’s youth are able to benefit from such resources.” Prof Murwira said the Government has achieved milestones through the revenue collected by the Fund, which has financed the establishment of Innovation Hubs and Agro-Industrial Parks, as well as the construction of a Pathological Research and Diagnostic Centre that was officially commissioned by President Mnangagwa last year in the Midlands province.  Zimdef is also funding the MSU Innovation Hub, which is an innovation agency owned by the business, innovation and enterprise development department. Some of the projects that have come out include the development and implementation of an electronic wireless-based water usage prepaid metre, the development and implementation of a hydrogen-based off-grid solar power storage system, and the production of a medicine to cure breast cancer. The other projects include; the construction of the University of Zimbabwe Quinary Hospital, which will offer services that cover hydro-physiotherapy, oncology, cardiovascular services, renal transplant, feto-material, integrated out-patients department, executive clinic (VIP/VVIP), hotel and road and air access to the facility. Meanwhile, Zimdef chief executive officer, Mr Sebastain Marume, said their rebranding journey was meant to reposition the institution in line with the overall national development goals. <img class="size-large wp-image-602851" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay Zimdef projects buttress the Government’s heritage-based education 5.0 model, which was adopted four years ago and seeks to produce graduates who solve national problems instead of just being job seekers. The transition from traditional ways of teaching and learning to build an innovation-led and knowledge-driven economy by 2025, as espoused in the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1) would significantly contribute towards the attainment of an upper-middle income economy by 2030.
