The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE National Association for Primary Heads (Naph) will hold an executive meeting in Gweru on Friday where the headmasters are expected to adopt proposed dates for the 2023 sporting activities. Naph president Cynthia Khumalo said the country’s primary schools are ready to roll out all sporting programmes in 2023, after the last three years’ activities were affected by Covid-19.
To kick start the sports calendar year, the first term will have the traditional athletics with ball games set to be played in the second and third terms.  “All is set for athletics and on Friday the Naph executive has a planning meeting in Gweru. It is in Gweru where we’re going to have the tentative dates for the national athletics finals that will be hosted by Mashonaland West Province.
“We will also confirm the dates for other activities for the year, with host provinces set to confirm if the dates that have been proposed are feasible for activities,” Khumalo said. The Naph president said they hope to continue with the same aura of excitement which gripped primary schools’ learners as well as teachers following resumption of sport in June last year after a two-year hiatus caused by Covid-19.
Matabeleland South were the host of the ball games that were eventually held in Bulawayo. Due to financial constraints faced by Naph, only boys’ soccer, netball, basketball and volleyball were staged at the national finals. <img class="size-large wp-image-673806" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/hbv-fgv-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/hbv-fgv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/hbv-fgv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Confederation of Schools Sports Association of Southern Africa Meanwhile, having last participated at the Confederation of Schools Sports Association of Southern Africa (Cossasa) games in 2019, Khumalo is optimistic of returning to the regional meet.
“If all goes well and nothing changes, we’re hoping to get back to the Cossasa games. It is highly likely that we will be sending a team for the Cossasa athletics meet which traditionally takes place during the April school holidays. The dates for the Cossasa athletics finals are yet to be announced,” Khumalo said. – @ZililoR
