The Chronicle   Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter LAST week, Bulawayo-born and Los Angeles-based musician, producer and renowned songwriter Daecolm (real name Daecolm Diego Holland) touched base in Bulawayo to equip local artistes with requisite songwriting skills when he facilitated a workshop.

We have so much talent here and I want to assist where possible and share whatever tools I can to help them reach their goals. I’ve been blessed with opportunities in my life and it’s really important for me to reach back and lift everyone else up. “That’s why I’m working with local artists and also giving this workshop – we all have a part to play,” he said. The charismatic vocalist and writer shared information on song structure, maintaining your identity, branding and promotion with the artistes. In attendance at the workshop were Daecolm’s parents Jubbie and Althea Holland as well as local artistes Asaph, Maggie Soulbird, Absoll Luz, T3rry Tempo, Da, Kudu, King Bill, Bhila and Rudo Amor who got to learn, first hand, how to be lyrical geniuses. Def Jam signed artist Asaph said: “It’s very cool to hear from someone who’s worked with so many international icons. So, getting knowledge from someone who’s been exposed to such a high level is always priceless. For me, it’s showing me the level I can go to as well if I just put in the work and believe in myself.” <img class="wp-image-669948 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jhgsdghf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jhgsdghf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jhgsdghf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Daecolm Musician Maggie Soul Bird said: “It was really informative. As a songwriter, I personally need more of these. So I’m really grateful to the organisers of this whole event. Thank you. It sometimes feels like it’s difficult to be a songwriter who’s not a singer, but I’m realising I can also make it as just a songwriter and I like having that knowledge.” Daecolm was the perfect fit to teach local acts songwriting skills as he has worked with Usher, Omarion, Trey Songz, Craig David, Mario, and Ella Mai in the past. Complementary to songwriting insights, Daecolm also shared tips on social media content creation and told Chronicle Showbiz that he will be working on a new album with local producer Irvine “Da Kudu” Ronney. Daecolm was in Bulawayo for a few weeks over Christmas to spend time with his family before he jetted off to South Africa and Ghana to work on new music with a number of A-list African stars. – @eMKlass_49
