The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter EX-HIGHLANDERS Football Club striker Patrick “Mboma” Mpofu is grateful to the love and support that he is getting from former footballers as he works on his recovery. Mpofu, who has been unwell for some time, said besides his family, former players and friends have provided unwavering support during his time of need. Yesterday, his former teammate at Highlanders, Johannes Ngodzo representing the Football Ambassadors accompanied Mpofu to hospital for his medical appointment. <img class="alignnone wp-image-499772 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Johannes-Ngodzo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Johannes-Ngodzo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Johannes-Ngodzo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Johannes Ngodzo “It hasn’t been easy but I’m grateful to everyone who has stood by me up to this day, my family, friends and former footballers who’ve shown great love, giving me hope to fight on. By God’s grace, I’m going to recover,” said Mpofu with a low hoarse voice. The ex-Highlanders forward whose greatest highlight in Bosso colours was scoring the winning goal in the 2-1 victory against a star-studded Caps United at Barbourfields Stadium in 2005, which made him an instant darling, said the former players have provided medical assistance and groceries.  A crew that had Castro Ndebele, Graham Ncube and Zephaniah Ngodzo among others presented groceries to Mpofu at his Entumbane home on Sunday.  The 38-year-old ex-Bosso star’s nephew Josphat Sibanda said his uncle is still due for medical tests, which include a brain scan. “There are people who’ve responded to calls for help who include ex-footballers and friends. Right now there’s some medication that is being administered to him and Tshisa (Johannes) came to pick him up and to accompany him to the hospital. He still has to do a brain scan as well as some organ tests after this and those keen to assist him can contact me on 0780 997 757 or my grandmother on 0774 559 333,” said Sibanda. Johannes said: “He is one of us and will always be one of us and we will continue to assist as friends and former players whenever we can. It’s all in the spirit of oneness, the brotherly love that goes beyond the football pitch or happy times.” -@ZililoR
