The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief GWERU residents have urged the local authority and private land developers to expedite the clearing of storm water drains and construct others in some areas to curb flooding. During rainy seasons streets in the city centre and in residential areas flood leading to traffic congestion and loss of property, hence the residents’ appeal. Flooding in Gweru is common in the city centre and suburbs such as Athlone, Riverside, Mambo, Mtapa, Mkoba 6, 4, 9, Nashville, Montrose, Senga and in the new settlements such as Clifton Park, Mutasa and Mtautsi Park. Poor maintenance of drainage systems has led to silt, garbage and other obstructions reducing the carrying capacity of the drainage system and resulting in flooding. According to the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), annual flood losses are expected to double by 2030 if no measures are taken to lessen the burden on drainage systems. <img class="alignnone wp-image-626527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environmental Management Agency (EMA) Gweru Residents and Ratepayers Association director (GRRA) Mr Cornelius Selipiwe said the local authority and private land developers must invest in the construction of stormwater drains. “Generally the regularity and scale of flooding of roads and homes have increased over the years owing to incessant rains, clogged drains and uncollected garbage. Flooding is occurring in the city centre as well as in residential areas. We call on council and private land developers to invest in new storm water drains as well as clearing the existing ones,” he said. Mr Charles Mazorodze of Gweru Residents Forum (GRF) said drainage clearance must be done periodically by council and land developers.  He urged residents in the suburbs and vendors to assist by not littering the drainage system. “There is a need for a collaborative approach from all concerned stakeholders in keeping the stormwater drainage system clean of rubbish. Residents are supposed to put litter in bins and not throw litter in storm drains. Council should in turn periodically clean the stormwater drains,” said Mr Mazorodze. <img class="alignnone wp-image-671860 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-17-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-17-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Charles Mazorodze The chairman of Gweru Residents Trust (GRT) Mr Antony Madzivanyika called on residents and the local authority to take the clean-up campaign drive launched by President Mnangagwa in 2018 seriously. “We must have a collective effort as residents and council and other stakeholders to keep our environment clean. But once we realise that the environment is dirty, it is prudent for us to clean it. We have for example the monthly clean-up campaigns launched by the President which must also be taken seriously as they are crucial to the well-being of the environment,” he said. Council’s spokesperson, Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee said council is embarking on a storm drain clearance exercise in a bid to reduce the effects of flash floods. <img class="alignnone wp-image-629500 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Vimbai Chingwaramusee She said there is a programme for “roadside drainage clearing exercise” which has seen council workers working in teams in various wards in the city. “As the City of Gweru, we have engaged 44 people for roadside drainage clearing exercise. In 2022 we covered around 15 km. In 2023 we have covered 2km so far,” said Ms Chingwaramusee. Some of the roads being attended to include Njomane and Zaranyika in Ward 7, Garikayi location in Ward 6, Rufaro and Ascot Infill in Ward 8, among others. The Minister of Local Government and Public Works July Moyo last Friday directed all local authorities to clear storm drains and collect garbage in their areas of jurisdiction to minimise the impact of floods and waterborne diseases, respectively. He said the issue of informal, illegal and dysfunctional settlements is indeed a thorn in the flesh. Minister Moyo said local authorities should set aside a reasonable percentage of their budgets towards Disaster Risk Reduction.
