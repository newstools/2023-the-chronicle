The Ikula singer told Chronicle Showbiz that he will be a busy man in 2023. “This year is about new stuff and inventions. It will be more music and live performances, in and out of the country. There’ll be a couple of international collaborations as well, as a way of exporting what we have been creating throughout the past years outside under a new genre we will call Zimbabwe Pop Music (Zipop). “For a while, we have been consuming cultures and genres that are not ours and seeing how the world is eyeing Africa.

MJ Sings is set to perform at the “Kings and Queens Showcase” show where he will share the stage with former Nobuntu member, Ratie D and Obabes bembube, Nobuntu at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Friday. – @eMKlass_49
