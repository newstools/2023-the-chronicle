ZIMBABWE’S Under-19 team has left the country for South Africa where they will be participating in the inaugural International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 Women’s Cricket World Cup. The final squad which was announced last week, is led by experienced all-rounder, Kelis Ndhlovu. The 16-team global showpiece will run from January 14 to 29. Zimbabwe are in Group B alongside England, Pakistan and Rwanda. Coached by Trevor Phiri, the Young Lady Chevrons’ first game is against England on January 15 at JB Marks Oval. They then play continental rivals Rwanda on January 17 at the North West University Oval before taking on Pakistan two days later at the same venue.  All Group B matches will be played in Potchefstroom and the top two teams will progress to the Super Six phase where qualifying teams from Group A will play against qualifying teams from Group D, and qualifying teams from Group B will play against qualifying teams from Group C.
