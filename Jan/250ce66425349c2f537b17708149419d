The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TALKS between Bulawayo Chiefs Football Club and their former coach Farai Tawachera have stalled after the latter reportedly received a better offer from another topflight club. <img class="alignnone wp-image-650183 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/xzczxza.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/xzczxza.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/xzczxza-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Farai Tawachera Chiefs are said to have made contact with Tawachera as they seek to replace Thulani Sibanda who is reportedly headed for Triangle United. <img class="alignnone wp-image-659594 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/ydnghj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/ydnghj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/ydnghj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Former Bulawayo Chiefs Coach Thulani Sibanda A source told this publication that Tawachera weighed his options before deciding on not joining Chiefs. “The situation may look gloomy but they are working (Chiefs). Tawachera has been approached but nothing has materialised as it seems he has settled elsewhere. “There had been discussion for some time now. The situation with head coach Nilton Terroso is still not clear but it is highly likely that he will not be returning,” said the source. Contacted for a comment Tawachera could neither deny nor confirm any of the speculation regarding his future.  “With regard to what l will be doing next l have no comment,” said Tawachera. Tawachera was fired by the club as assistant coach last season and went to coach rivals Bulawayo City. After firing Tawachera and Mark Mathe, Bulawayo Chiefs re-engaged Sibanda as assistant coach to Terroso. <img class="alignnone wp-image-598561 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Nilton-Terroso.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Nilton-Terroso.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Nilton-Terroso-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nilton Terroso Tawachera has previously been with the now defunct Tsholotsho and was recently fired as assistant coach by Bulawayo Chiefs together with co-assistant Mark Mathe for poor results. At Bulawayo City, Tawachera tried to save Amakhosi from relegation but his efforts were in vain. Being relegated means they must play Division One football this year. However, financial constraints at the club are pushing the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) to consider disbanding the team. -@innocentskizoe
