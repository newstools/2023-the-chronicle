When we finished working on the song, I was convinced that there was something special about him. “As such, working with Msiz’kay is forever going to be on the cards,” said Zimbiyana Jones. He said his forthcoming album has been in the making since 2019 as a lot of changes had to be made including replacing some of the songs. The album will feature Nutty O, Msiz’kay, TRK who is based in Germany and Pheelip Muse from Nigeria.
