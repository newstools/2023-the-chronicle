They ran out of luck  after they were apprehended while intending to break into the third house. Despite having been stabbed, the victim Costen Mundenguma clung on to Dube and called for help from the neighbours who helped in arresting him. Midlands Police Spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the incident. “One of the two robbers was arrested following an armed robbery spree in which they broke into three houses in Kwekwe in one night,” he said. On the night of Dube’s arrest, the two reportedly broke a door using machetes before stealing books and cellphones.  In the second house, they also broke into a house in Mbizo 16 where they stole cash and cellphones. They then entered Mundenguma’s house in Mbizo 10 before they switched off lights and lit their torch lights. “Mundenguma was awakened by the noise and confronted the suspects who retaliated and stabbed him with a knife all over the body. Mundenguma managed to grab Dube by the neck while shouting for help,” said Insp Mahoko. <img class="alignnone wp-image-546236 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Emmanuel-Mahoko.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Emmanuel-Mahoko.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Emmanuel-Mahoko-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko “Neighbours came out in their numbers and helped apprehend Dube.
