The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter WITH an award of a new pool table set to be won in June, unheralded Stanley “Mjuda” Ngwenya on Sunday conquered all and sundry at Golden Pillars to be crowned champion at the newly introduced Bulawayo Blackball Weekly tournament. The weekly contest is being conducted every Sunday in different venues around Bulawayo.
In the first edition, Andile Ndlovu, who last season did duty for Queens Pool Academy, came out to earn five points in the continuing race. Last weekend, Ngwenya came out the third best player in the process amassing three points in a development that has taken his points tally to eight in a competition that points will matter most come mid-year.
“It’s a new initiative that seeks to keep our professional players and nonprofessional players on the tables.  We are very much grateful for the support we have got for a tournament that is played in a points format. The overall winner will get a pool table in June,” said Bulawayo Pool Association publicity secretary Osborne-wells Dziko.
The playing format of the weekly event is a race to five where walk over rules apply in case of a failure to be at the venue on time. Kamohelo Dube, Ronald Mutikani, Lindani Gumpo, Norman Moto, Morris Chinogwira and Darlington Dziko finished as the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh best players in the second week of the competition respectively that finished in the wee hours of Monday morning. — @FungaiMuderere
