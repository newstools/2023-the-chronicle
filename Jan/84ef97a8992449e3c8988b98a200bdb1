The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter BULAWAYO has been touted as the country’s artistic and cultural hub, a feat that has been buttressed by the Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Dr Sithembiso Nyoni. During her visit to Bulawayo recently, the minister was blown away by performances from up-and-coming Afro-fusion songstress Thuli Sithimbili and dancer Crysiss (real name Mike Muponda), prompting her to utter, “Wow, Bulawayo artistes are a charm”.  During a courtesy call to Sipho Mazibuko at the Lavinia Gardens, Minister Sithembiso Nyoni got a chance to experience a live performance from the aforementioned creatives. “Bulawayo artistes are a charm and this level of talent needs to be harnessed as I’ve been blown away by what I’m seeing. We need to do more for our local artistes and creatives. We should make sure that they grow and try to source funding for recording sessions,” said Dr Nyoni. <img class="wp-image-674985 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-36-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-36-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-36-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thuli Sithimbili Minister Sithembiso Nyoni surely left a lasting impression on Thuli Sithimbili who sang praises of the minister’s humility and openness. “The minister is humble and approachable. I was motivated by all the kind words she said to me. She’s not snobbish and such a character trait makes her adorable and lovable. Performing for her was the highlight of the day for me as I wasn’t anticipating seeing or performing in her midst. “It was all a pleasant surprise and a day that I’ll forever cherish,” said Sithimbili. <img class="wp-image-674992 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-37-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-37-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-37-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Crysiss Dancer, Crysiss was also buzzing. “Meeting the Minister was great. The mere fact that she is knowledgeable about art was good to see. Performing in her midst was mind-blowing and unbelievable as well,” said Crysiss. In September last year Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube promised to set up a recording studio in Bulawayo as a way to nurture artistic talent in the city. And in November last year, minister Ncube handed out music recording equipment to a number of artistes.  — @eMKlass_49
