The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief EARLY Saturday morning between Khartoum Street and 4th Avenue, Gwanda turns into a hive of activity as entrepreneurs get down to the business of selling various wares at Khothama Boutique. There, one can buy clothing items for as little as US$1. The business has become a viable side hustle for many who spend their weekdays at work. The Gwanda Khothama hustle which started with a few traders has grown over the years. The traders used to sell mainly second-hand clothing items but some now sell brand new clothes. Some have also introduced tupperware and cosmetics. They throng their selling points mostly on Saturdays. On Sundays, a few turn up as they would have gone to church. The Khothama Boutique traders pay a daily fee of R30 or US$2 for the weekend. Some of them are regulars while some trade occasionally. They mainly buy their goods from South Africa and Mozambique. <img class="alignnone wp-image-557586 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/money.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/money.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/money-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khothama Boutiques which started in big cities have gained momentum in small towns. They are traditionally flea markets where dealers sell second-hand clothes. A Gwanda Khothama Boutique dealer, Ms Sithabile Nhliziyo said they usually record good business on monthends. “I have been operating from Khothama Boutique for the past two years. I’m employed and during the week I will be at work and during the weekends I come here. If I’m busy my child comes along. I buy second-hand clothes from Mozambique and I sell them. I sell different clothing items from adult clothes to children’s clothes,” she said. “I sell some of my clothing items for as little as US$1 depending on what I will be having. Some weekends are slow but the monthend is when we record brisk business. That is when many people come to buy. We don’t make a lot of money but the profits do help us to get by.” Another trader, Mrs Linda Ncube said business was high especially when she buys new stock. She said she usually informs her customers and neighbours when she has new stock and they come in numbers in order to select the best products. Ms Ncube said some of the second-hand clothes will be looking brand new. She said they make it a point to buy clothes that go along with the season. Ms Ncube said they run their operations strategically just like established clothing shops. “When it’s towards winter we start stocking winter clothes and when its towards summer we bring in summer clothing. Some people come to our place to do their shopping for their entire family. When it’s the festive season we record a lot of business. Some clients prefer to come and buy from us because our prices are lower and they can get brand new clothes from our place at a bargain,” she said. Ms Ncube said they have improved their quality of stock in a bid to please their clients. Mr Promise Ngwenya who is also a trader at the boutique said the business helps him to put food on the table. He is self-employed and he takes advantage of the weekend hustle to make extra cash. Mr Ngwenya said operating from Khothama second-hand clothes requires strategy as there were many players who were selling similar items. He said social media helps him to market his business. Mr Ngwenya said he keeps his clients and friends updated on the stock he has through WhatsApp. He said his contacts then go on to advise other people and the network grows wider. “A lot of people are now selling at the flea market which makes it difficult to get customers. Some of us are stationed in the middle of the road which means people start selecting from the far ends. I have learnt to build my clientele base through social media so that people will come and buy from me specifically,” he said. <img class="wp-image-566188 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Gwanda-Mayor-Clr-Njabulo-Siziba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Gwanda-Mayor-Clr-Njabulo-Siziba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Gwanda-Mayor-Clr-Njabulo-Siziba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gwanda Mayor Clr Njabulo Siziba Gwanda mayor, Clr Njabulo Siziba said the Khothama flea market was established after traders appealed for space to operate from. He said council has a register of the operators for payment purposes. Clr Siziba said the traders are allowed to operate during weekends to ensure that there is no congestion on the streets during weekdays as they operate outside office premises. He said the flea market is a means of ensuring that people have a source of income. – @DubeMatutu
