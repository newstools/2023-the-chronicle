OMADU Lodge in Plumtree is set to forever be known as the first venue to host the inaugural Miss Tourism Mangwe Beauty Pageant set for January 28. The pageant being organised by the Matabeleland South Youth In Tourism is set to afford one of the 20 participants a chance to be crowned Queen of Mangwe District.  Some of the participants who will vie for the coveted crown include Cleopatra Mpofu, Mbalenthle Ncube, Melisa Dube, Moesha Ncube, Siphiwesihle Dube, Nobuhle Khumalo, Prominance Dube, Thandiswa Ncube, Teenytages Ndebele, Margret Manogwe, Lubelihle Ngwenya, Michelle Sibanda, Zibusiso Selom, and Nobuhle Ngwenya. Matabeleland South provincial deputy director who is part of the organising team, Simphiwe Mguni said preparations are at an advanced stage. “Preparations for the inaugural Miss Tourism Mangwe are going smoothly. We’ve arranged a spectacular line-up for the day. The purpose of the pageant is to kick off our organisation and promote tourism in Mangwe,” Mguni said. “The theme of the pageant is ‘Sustainable tourism in Mangwe’ which is green tourism, a concept that covers the complete tourism experience from concern for economic, social and environmental issues as well as attention to improving tourists’ experiences and addressing the needs of host communities,” she said. <img class="size-large wp-image-673787" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fxsfgdfhg-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fxsfgdfhg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fxsfgdfhg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Simphiwe Mguni Entertainment will be in overload as seasoned artistes such as Sandra Ndebele, Ma9nine and Clement Magwaza are set to take to the stage. Mguni said the participants will strut on the ramp clad in safari, traditional, and evening gowns.
“They’ll also have to put on their thinking caps as there’ll be a Question and Answer session based on sustainable tourism.” To break new ground, the Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Nqobizitha Ndlovu will be the guest of honour. The pageant will also be used as a springboard for a bigger pageant which will be piloted soon. <img class="size-large wp-image-611977" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-61-6-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-61-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-61-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Nqobizitha Ndlovu “This first edition will be like a trial phase, the first of its kind. It’s going to be the first of a series of Miss Tourism pageants in Matabeleland South. Ultimately, there’ll be a Miss Tourism Matabeleland South pageant. The Minister is in full support of this function and he’ll surely surprise everyone with something huge,” said Mguni.
Winners will walk away with various prizes. Miss Tourism Mangwe will receive prize money and an opportunity to be part of future activities as the Mangwe South Youth In Tourism Ambassador. The top three winners will go on to compete at the Miss Tourism Matabeleland South pageant.
This pageant will be a prelude to the Miss and Mr Rural Zimbabwe pageant set to be held in May. – @eMKlass_49
