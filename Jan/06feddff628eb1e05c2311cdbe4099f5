HWANGE Local Board (HLB) has set aside land to build an animal pound where stray livestock will be kept at a cost to the owners as the local authority seeks ways of clearing animals from the town centre. Hwange town has for years been having challenges with stray animals particularly cattle, goats, sheep and pigs that roam the streets in search of grazing and water. Cattle and goats usually graze along the street that goes past the District Development Coordinator’s offices and Hwange Colliery offices.
HLB acting Town Secretary Mr Paulos Mabhureni said efforts to engage livestock owners have not yielded the expected results.  He said council had therefore resolved to construct a pound where stray animals will be kept.
“Last week workers from our planning section identified a suitable area to set up a livestock pound and work on the project is expected to start soon,” said Mr Mabhureni. He said stray animals had become a nuisance as they were destroying gardens and endangering motorists.
Mr Mabhureni said the local authority is mandated to control livestock movement within its juridiction. The proposed pound is expected to have holding pens, troughs and an area meant for the vaccination of the impounded animals. Owners are going to be charged a fee for having their animals kept at the pound and animals that are not collected within a stipulated period will be disposed of through a public auction. Mr Mabhureni said the delay in having a pound was due to financial challenges.
