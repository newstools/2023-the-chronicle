The Chronicle Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter A BULAWAYO-based company, Dream House Construction has refurbished the famous Bulawayo twin sisters, the Mabaisas’ house Entumbane suburb in fulfilment of a pledge the company made on their 70th birthday. The Mabaisa twins’ birthday celebration was held last year on October 11 at True Elegance Restaurant in Bulawayo. In a recent interview with this paper, the pair vowed they will never get married if they do not find a pair of twins to tie the knot with. Granny Vee (Violet) and Granny Jay (Jester), unfortunately, were not so lucky to find twins who could marry them hence they continue to live as single mums. They bore two children each, although Violet lost a daughter in 2005. To ensure that they never have to stay away from each other, Granny Vee and Granny Jay bought two semi-detached houses in 1981 in Entumbane suburb and built a perimeter wall around them.  Dream House Construction operations manager Mr Mandlenkosi Zulu said the company management got to know of the twins through Trevor Kaitse and Lubelihle Banda who were organising and raising funds for the two women’s birthday party. “We have renovated their house as promised and we also want to change the exterior doors, fix broken windows and paint the whole house including the roof,” said Mr Zulu. He said the gesture is part of ploughing back to the community. The twins, famously known for wearing matching outfits expressed appreciation for the gesture. “We are so happy that Mr Zulu has refurbished the outside part of our home. This is a great job and we are grateful for his efforts and we urge him to extend the gesture to other citizens,” said Jester. <img class="wp-image-675081 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/The-twins-at-their-70th-birthday-celebrations.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/The-twins-at-their-70th-birthday-celebrations.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/The-twins-at-their-70th-birthday-celebrations-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The twins at their 70th birthday celebrations Four years ago, Dream House Construction Company assisted a Cowdray Park family by refurbishing their house which had been gutted by fire.
