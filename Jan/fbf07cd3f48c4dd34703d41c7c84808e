In as much as our liberation stalwarts liberated the country politically, the young generation should be at the forefront in terms of the country’s economic liberation,” said Cde Chiponda.  “Youths should explore business opportunities in all sectors of the economy to empower themselves. This also speaks to the President’s philosophy ‘nyika inovakwa nevene vayo/ ilizwe lakhiwa ngabaninilo’. Cde Chiponda noted that some young people had a tendency of making mistakes by venturing into business without first conducting adequate research. “Many a time we have young people venturing into business blindly without having done any research about their business. The Second Republic is determined and dedicated to giving youths a chance to delve into businesses with adequate knowledge by offering such platforms as the YEDED,” he said. “Not only is the Second Republic ready to support youths, but the Government is investing in projects that are helping youth entrepreneurs countrywide. This is why youth entrepreneurs have organisations like Zimra, ZimTrade and the Youth Empowerment Bank at their disposal of youth.” Apart from the Youth Empowerment Bank, the Second Republic has also established Youth Desks in every ministry to mainstream the needs of the youths, while on other hand, the Revised National Youth Policy is yet another demonstration of commitment by President Mnangagwa’s administration to providing practical solutions to challenges faced by young people. YEDED Chairman, Cde Clemence Kadungure commended the Second Republic for making great strides in supporting entrepreneurial youths. <img class="alignnone wp-image-672477 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Young-Enterpreneurs-and-Directors-for-ED3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Young-Enterpreneurs-and-Directors-for-ED3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Young-Enterpreneurs-and-Directors-for-ED3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clemence Kadungure the Young Enterpreneurs and Directors for Economic Development speaking during a launch meeting that was held at Mhlahlandlela in Bulawayo yesterday(Picture by Fortunate Nkomo) He said the YEDED platform will help promote businesses and social networks economically both locally and abroad. “The support that we are getting as entrepreneurs will help us towards economic growth, job creation and total ownership of our economy. We call upon all businesses, big and small, to come and link, connect and expand with us,” said Cde Kadungure. ZimTrade southern region manager, Mrs Jacqueline Nyathi said their organisation offers youth entrepreneurial programmes in support of their efforts. “We offer a wide range of services that work in support of youths as well as training programmes that boost companies, be it export market companies or local operating companies,” she said. “For some, they do not have adequate information in terms of their target market or even operational agreements, especially when operating out of the country hence we come in handy by offering such services that promote their companies.” A young entrepreneur, Mr Tinashe Chihota said the Second Republic is promoting the inclusion of youths in developmental issues. <img class="alignnone wp-image-672471 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Young-Enterpreneurs-and-Directors-for-ED-7yjpg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Young-Enterpreneurs-and-Directors-for-ED-7yjpg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Young-Enterpreneurs-and-Directors-for-ED-7yjpg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Young enterpreneurTinashe Chihota who also commentend on the launch of Young Enterpreneurs and Directors for Economic Development meeting that was held at Mhlahlandlela in Bulawayo yesterday(Picture by Fortunate Nkomo) “The launch was significant to us as youths as it allowed us to get an understanding of the business community as well as giving us knowledge on the steps to follow when one is to venture into the business world,” he said. “Such platforms are a clear reflection of how supportive and open the Second Republic is when it comes to working with the youth.” Mr Chihota urged youths to take up such opportunities availed by the Government.–@Sagepapie14
