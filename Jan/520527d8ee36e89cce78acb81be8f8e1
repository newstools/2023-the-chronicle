The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN international Jordan Zemura played the entire 90 minutes as he returned to the Bournemouth starting eleven in their one all draw against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. The fullback, who had missed the side’s last two games put on a solid shift that saw Sky Sports give him a rating of seven out of 10. <img class="size-large wp-image-584145" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-11-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-11-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-11-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jordan Zemura Zemura was showered with praise for the performance. Bournemouth are in the relegation zone as they sit third from bottom on the table having collected 17 points from 20 games.  Bournemouth’s elimination from the FA Cup means they have next weekend off, with their next Premier League game being a trip to Brighton on February 4. Tendayi Darikwa played no part in his side’s loss to Luton Town in the championship. He was an unused substitute. In Saudi Arabia, Knowledge Musona also suffered a defeat. His side lost the 1-0 to Al-Wehda. Elsewhere, forward Ishmael Wadi’s fine form for South African first division side JDR Stars continued as he was on target in the side’s 5-0 win over TTM on Sunday. It took Wadi 14 minutes to go on score sheet and put his team one up. The goal moved his goal-scoring tally to seven. — @innocentskizoe
