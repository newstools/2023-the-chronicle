The Chronicle The Masire family still runs the city of gold despite being plagued by secrets, lies, and betrayals and a new king stepping into power when Netflix original series Kings of Jo’burg returns for a second season on Friday. They return in the eight-part series to pick up the pieces and maintain their position without Simon ‘Vader’ Masire (played by the late Shona Ferguson). Mogomotsi ‘Mo’ Masire (played by Zolisa Xaluva) reluctantly takes over from his brother Simon following his sudden and untimely disappearance on-screen.  “Sacrifices are made and alliances forged as the family is hunted by new enemies while trying to maintain its position in the city of gold,” a press statement reads. Returning cast members include Thembi Seete, Buhle Samuels, Cindy Mahlangu and Connie Ferguson, while new cast members include Sello Maake ka Ncube, Thapelo Mokoena and Lunathi Mampofu. Executive producer and showrunner Samad Davis and executive producer Ferguson described this season as a tribute to the “late great” Shona, who died of Covid-19-related complications in July 2021. – News24
