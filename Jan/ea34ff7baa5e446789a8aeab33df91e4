The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN international Terrence Dzvukamanja did not bother to celebrate his last minute goal for Orlando Pirates as he was subjected to jeers and booing from the Buccaneers fans on his late introduction in which he went on to find the target as the Sea Robbers defeated Golden Arrows 3-1 in a DStv Premiership match played at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Dzvukamanja replaced Namibian Deon Kavendji in the 74th minute with the score line between Pirates and Arrows 1-1.
The Zimbabwean striker was met with jeers upon his introduction but went on to put Pirates in the lead during second-half stoppage time with the assist coming from Monnapule Saleng. Another second-half substitute Vincent Pule scored the third goal moments later to give Pirates a 3-1 victory over Arrows. The victory saw Pirates end their three-match losing streak.  After the game coach Jose Riveiro was pleased with Dzvukamanja’s showing against the odds.
“In this case as an individual I’m so happy that it was justice, he came in against all the odds, was very badly received but he managed to score, which is going to be very important for the team. “I think Terrence and all the players who came off the bench did a fantastic job, not only because we scored because it’s a reality that he’s not been playing regularly coming into the game he was in a very difficult scenario,’’ said Riveiro.
Dzvukamanja is believed to be on his way out of the club as he has seen little game time at the Soweto giants this season and the incident at the weekend could be a catalyst for his departure. The Zimbabwean forward joined Pirates in September 2020 from the now defunct Bidvest Wits. While Dzvukamanja was on the victorious side, the Zimbabwean pair of left back Divine Lunga and Knox Mutizwa were on the losing end. Lunga played the entire 90 minutes while Mutizwa was replaced by Ryan Moon in the 83rd minute, shortly after getting booked. — @innocentskizoe
