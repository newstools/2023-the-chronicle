The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HWANGE Football Club coach Bongani Mafu says he has all the faith in the squad that won Chipangano promotion into the topflight league and he will not be making wholesome changes to the team. Mafu has a number of experienced players in his side which include former Highlanders’ skipper Felix Chindungwe, ex-Chicken Inn midfielders Canaan Nkomo and Thabani Goredema as well as goalkeeper Nedrick Madeya, who formerly was at Highlanders. <img class="alignnone wp-image-283178 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/10/Felix-Chindungwe-etched-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="436" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/10/Felix-Chindungwe-etched-1.png 640w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/10/Felix-Chindungwe-etched-1-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> Felix Chindungwe The likes of Chidungwe, Nkomo and Goredema were said to have been roped in for the purpose of regaining promotion but it appears they are in for another run in the topflight league. <img class="alignnone wp-image-655619 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-8-18-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-8-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-8-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Canaan Nkomo with his Hwange Football Club Player of the Year accolade “I think we cannot have people winning promotion then discard them,” said Mafu.  “I believe the experienced guys can have one or two boys as understudies. They can teach the young boys a lot of valuable football lessons. Our plan is to have a look at our squad from last year before we call in players we think can add value to the team. “You can expect to see one or two new faces in the next weeks but we are not expecting to have too many changes to the squad,” Mafu added. He said the immediate goal for his team is to win their first game. “Our target for the season will be set by the level of competition in the league. Right now, the target is to win our first game,” said Mafu. Chipangano won the 2022 Zifa Southern Region Division One League to earn a ticket back to the top league from which they were demoted in 2019. —@innocentskizoe
