The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League 2021/2022 season first runners up, Chicken Inn, are set to regroup today with the club’s secretary general Tavengwa Hara saying the players will engage in a meeting with their coaches before they go for medicals. With a number of local topflight league sides that include former champions Dynamos, new comers Simba Bhora and PSL returnees Hwange among others already fine tuning ahead of the start of the 2023 season, Hara said the Gamecocks will start their full pre-season programme next week Monday.  “After a long festive season break, as a club we are regrouping on Friday (today) and that is when our players will have a meeting with their coaches where they will openly discuss a number of issues pertaining to the 2023 season and the past season. After the meeting, the players will go for medicals that will help us to tell that everyone in our team is fully fit,” said Hara. Asked if they were done with their player recruitment, the veteran football administrator said: “I wouldn’t say much but we are happy that we managed to retain most of our contracted players. So, with us it is a continuation of where we left from last year.” Gamecocks are set to welcome club returnee Obriel Chirinda from Bulawayo Chiefs, a club that has recently been hit by player unrest following their failure to pay salaries on time in the past season. At the end of November last year Gamecocks beat DeMbare to the signature of highly rated former Young Warriors forward, Calum English-Brown. English-Brown (21), whom is fondly known as the White Lion impressed with his individual performances during the 2021/2022 season for Whawha. — @FungaiMuderere
