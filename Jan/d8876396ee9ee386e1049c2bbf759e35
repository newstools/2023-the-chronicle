Those expected to attend include Zodwa Mnkandla, Nomathemba Ndebele who runs Posh Boutique in Harare, philanthropist Olinda Chapel as well as Sandra Ndebele. <img class="alignnone wp-image-672405 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-23-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-23-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-23-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zodwa Mnkandla Mazibuko said the event is being held in the City of Kings and Queens for the first time and the objective is to inspire other women to venture into business. “I  borrowed the idea from Olinda Chapel who has done exceedingly well in her business and has managed to connect people through such events,” said Mazibuko. She said if all goes according to plan, she will hold the event twice a year. “This event is open to all women, those aspiring to venture into business as well as those already into business. Every lady is invited to come and learn from those already running successful businesses. It is an opportunity to learn from the experiences of these leading businesswomen how to overcome challenges associated with running a business,” said Mazibuko. She said green will be the colour theme of the day and as such all those attending are expected to be in green attire as well as fascinators.  “Green has been setting trends internationally in fashion. It was the colour for the London Fashion Week last year and in April, it will be the colour theme for Paris Fashion Week. This is why we’re bringing the trend to Bulawayo as we have to be trendsetters,” said Mazibuko. As a way to assist the women, Mazibuko said, representatives from banks including Empower Bank Zimbabwe, Inclusive Bank, Women’s Bank, and BancABC have been invited to the event. She said the officials will give information on how women can access loans and other funding packages from their institutions. “Representatives from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) and the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) will also be there to educate women on the importance of paying taxes and getting tax clearance certificates. They will also educate them on how to go about their tax payments,” said Mazibuko. She said she had a nasty experience when Zimra officials raided her after tracking the amount of money in her bank accounts hence she decided to invite the officials. “Everything was seized and accounts were frozen. I then realised that I didn’t have knowledge on tax payments which is very important if one is to run a business,” said Mazibuko. She said there will be business classes on how to select a business one has a passion for to avoid a situation whereby individuals lose interest in the business along the way. On her part, Mazibuko said she will engage women mostly on health issues. “To be a wife, mother and businesswoman is at times very strenuous and difficult to manage.  It is therefore important to educate women on how to cope with such situations and avoid mental breakdowns,” she said. Entertainment will be provided by Mzoe 7 and Sandra Ndebele who will also share with the gathering, her success story. <img class="alignnone wp-image-672401 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-22-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-22-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-22-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sandra Ndebele “I’m so excited because the response is overwhelming but  I can only accommodate 200 guests,” said Mazibuko.
