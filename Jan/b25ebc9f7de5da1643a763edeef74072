The Chronicle  Millicent Dube, Showbiz Reporter Talk about the perfect timing to release a love song. Just a few weeks before Valentine’s Day, Bulawayo’s lover boy Amany has released a potential banger titled Novuyo. Novuyo is a fusion of Amapiano and Reggae produced by Larynx. It is a love song that tells the story of a secret admirer who has finally decided to reveal himself to his love interest. Amany, as the storyteller, pens a series of pick-up lines to try and win over the heart of his beloved. “Novuyo has been released in the lead-up to Valentine’s Day and is dedicated to people who have been involuntarily friend-zoned,” said Amany. <img class="alignnone wp-image-675549 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-5-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-5-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-5-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The single is part of Amany’s upcoming singles compilation titled ‘This Is Love’, which is scheduled for release in the first quarter of the year.
