The Chronicle    Business Reporter THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has cleared all outstanding foreign currency allocations on the auction system. The move is a positive boost to businesses and the productive sector who in the past complained over delays in the disbursement of funds after weekly allotments. In a statement today, RBZ governor Dr John Mangudya, said the clearance is due to improved foreign currency inflows in the country. <img class="wp-image-598844 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Mangudya-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Mangudya-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Dr-Mangudya-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr John Mangudya He said going forward the central bank will strive to ensure that foreign currency is available to successful bidders within 14 days from the date of auction. “The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is pleased to advise the public that it has cleared the backlog of foreign exchange allotments under the Foreign  Auction System,” said Dr Mangudya. “This development is a result of improved foreign currency inflows in the country.” However, the amount cleared was not indicated.
