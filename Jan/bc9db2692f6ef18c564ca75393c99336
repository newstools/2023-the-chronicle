On Sunday around 5pm Maphosa visited his wife with the intention to settle their difference,” said Insp Mahoko.
“While they were talking with the wife Maphosa became violent and Praise had to seek refuge at her neighbour Sisa Ndlovu’s homestead.  Sisa tried to counsel them to no avail until she called other neighbours to assist in solving their differences.”

He said the now-deceased sustained several wounds on the head following the attack and was rushed to Silobela District Hospital while his condition deteriorated and he died upon admission. A report was made to the Zimbabwe Republic Police at Silobela and police attended the scene.
