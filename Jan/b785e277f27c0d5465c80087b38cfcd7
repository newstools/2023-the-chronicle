THE Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) hopes to retain most of its major road races this year including the PPC Matopos Ultra Marathon. The event has been frozen for the last two years owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The ultra marathon is on the Bab calendar and is expected to be held in April. <img class="wp-image-594916 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ppc-zimb1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ppc-zimb1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/ppc-zimb1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> PPC Zimbabwe “We had a number of road races late last year and it is our hope that the number will increase this year. We are looking forward to big road races such as the PPC Matopos and the Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon,” said Bab Board chairperson Watson Madenyika.  The PPC Matopos Marathon, which includes the 33-miler (53km), 21km, 10km and 5km fun run, is the biggest road race in the city and usually attracts up to 3 000 runners. Another crowd puller, the Old Mutual Nkulumane Half Marathon, which is held in early May had also been put on halt due to the pandemic. The last edition of the Matopos Ultra Marathon in 2019 was won by Black Rhinos runner Andrew Chimbidzikai in a time of 3 hours 12 minutes 22 seconds. Nedbank’s Chiedza Chokore clocked 3 hours 57 minutes 17 seconds to take the women’s gong. — @innocentskizoe
