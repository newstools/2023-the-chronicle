The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Sports Editor TOTO Banda has left Highlanders and the club is saying the separation was as agreed to by the parties involved. Yesterday, Highlanders chairman Johnfat Sibanda informed members during the club’s Annual General Meeting that Banda as well as Crispen Ncube were not in the coach’s plans for the 2023 season. Toto is the son of Highlanders legend, Tanny Banda and joined Bosso in April 2021. <img class="wp-image-530661 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Johnfat-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Johnfat-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Johnfat-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Johnfat Sibanda “The club would like to announce the departure of Toto Banda who leaves the club on mutual consent. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours,’’ read a statement from Highlanders. Last week, Highlanders also issued a statement to the effect that Muziwakhe Dlamini had also left by mutual consent. Ncube is expected to follow in the coming days. Concerns have however been raised that Highlanders is releasing players but not making any meaningful signings. Their biggest rivals Dynamos have been on a player signing spree and now former Bulawayo Chiefs trio of the Moyo twins, Elvis and Kevin as well as Arthur Musiyiwa are part of the Glamour Boys. DeMbare have also secured Nyasha Chintuli and Elie Ilunga as coach Herbert Maruwa looks to build a formidable DeMbare side that can challenge for honours this season. Dynamos finished third in the 2021/23 season and Highlanders were fifth but one will be excused for concluding that DeMbare probably finished lower than Bosso given what is happening in the transfer business.  Highlanders were linked with Musiyiwa but he has been snapped up by Dynamos after leaving the financially troubled Bulawayo Chiefs. Bosso’s other targets at Chiefs, Malvin Mkolo and Mthokozisi Msebe are contracted to Amakhosi Amahle, which means Tshilamoya have to buy them as they are not free agents. Melikhaya Ncube, formerly with Bulawayo City is training with Highlanders and chances are high that Bosso might sign him. — @Mdawini_29
