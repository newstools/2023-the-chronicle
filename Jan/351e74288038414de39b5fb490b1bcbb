The Chronicle The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) preliminary delimitation report is expected to be tabled in Parliament tomorrow to pave way for debate by Parliament, with recommendations by the August House being submitted to President Mnangagwa. ZEC embarked on a voter registration blitz last year which was meant to inform the delimitation process ahead of this year’s harmonised elections.  After completing the process, ZEC, through its chairperson, Justice Priscilla Chigumba presented the preliminary report to President Mnangagwa at State House towards the end of December last year. After receiving the report, President Mnangagwa will cause the report to be tabled before Parliament which will then submit its recommendations to him. <img class="wp-image-612037 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZEC chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba The preliminary delimitation report will be tabled in Parliament where the Speaker of the National Assembly will advise that the Committee on Standing Rules is recommending the setting up of an adhoc committee, which will assist legislators in unpacking and coming up with recommendations. The report, produced by the adhoc committee, will be debated by the lower and upper houses and these will come up with resolutions that will be submitted to the President for onward recommendations to ZEC. <img class="wp-image-667483 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/hdueddbwjeb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/hdueddbwjeb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/hdueddbwjeb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa If by any chance, parliamentarians raise concerns, these will be included in the final report to President Mnangagwa who will also advise ZEC to make corrections before submitting the final delimitation report back to the President for gazetting. The delimitation report will determine how constituencies are allocated between provinces and how constituency and ward boundaries are drawn to match population distribution. – ZBC News
