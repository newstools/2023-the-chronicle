The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter WORLD Boxing Council Super Bantamweight interim title holder Kudakwashe Chiwandire is expected to go into camp next week in preparation for the WBC Gold Belt against WBC Super-Bantamweight world champion Yeimi Yamleth Mercado. The fight for the ultimate belt is set for Mexico at a date yet to be announced.
According to Chiwandire’s stable, Delta Force Promotions, Mercardo’s camp has agreed to host the match. This means that they will cover match fees and other costs related to staging the fight. <img class="size-large wp-image-604756" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-12-17-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-12-17.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-12-17-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kudakwashe Chiwandire Mercado, by being highly ranked compared to Chiwandire, had been given the first preference to host the fight by the WBC Women’s Championship Committee. Clyde Musonda, Delta Force founder and Chiwandire’ trainer said they are finalising on the contract.
“All is well and Chiwandire will be going into camp on 1 February.  We will know about the fight date after signing some outstanding documents but it’s definitely in February. Though I can’t confirm the date as of now, what I can tell you is that the fight will be in Mexico,” said Musonda. Popularly known as Take Money, Chiwandire got a shot at the WBC Gold belt after defeating Mexican challenger Zulina Munoz at the Harare International Conference Centre in October last year. Chiwandire won the bill that saw the Government intervening at the 11th hour to save the fight and give the Zimbabwean pugilist an opportunity to trade leather at the big stage by taking care of the costs for the Munoz bill. <img class="size-large wp-image-651721" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-13-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-13-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-13-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kudakwashe Chiwandire Winning against Munoz lifted Chiwandire’s ratings to sixth out of 168.
The Zimbabwean pugilist, whose stock has been rapidly rising will now face the world’s number two boxer, Mercado.
Chiwandire will be hoping to replicate the performance she put at the beginning of last year when she grabbed the prestigious bantamweight interim title on 26 February after defeating Catherine Phiri of Zambia. The victory saw her automatically become the highest ranked female boxer in Africa, across all weight categories and the only female boxer holding a World Boxing Council title on the African continent. The milestone also ensured she became the highest ranked Zimbabwean boxer in the history of boxing in this country.
Chiwandire, now Zimbabwe’s most successful female boxer in terms of level of titles won, got a recognition of US$15 000 from President Mnangagwa for winning in Zambia. – @ZililoR
