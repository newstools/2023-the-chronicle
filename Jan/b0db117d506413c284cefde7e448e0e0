The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Reporter THE United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) has applauded the country for having one of the highest net enrollment ratio in primary school on the African continent. In a statement to commemorate the international day of education Unicef country representative Dr Tajudeen Oyewale said there is need to explore new innovations and developments in the education sector to attract more children to enroll in line with global enrollment standards.  The organisation’s statistics show that nine out of 10 children of primary school age in Zimbabwe are in school and the figure has remained stable in the last decade, which is a remarkable accomplishment. “Zimbabwe has a high net enrollment ratio in primary school. Nine out of ten children of primary school age are in school. This is among the highest enrollment rates in primary schools on the African continent. This figure has remained stable in the last decade, which is a remarkable accomplishment. But our shared ambition is to do even more and reach universal enrollment of children in primary school,” said Unicef Dr Oyewale. He said the Government has expressed its clear ambition to make access to basic education free for every child in Zimbabwe as of 2023. “For that to happen more investment is required for basic education. Poverty and disabilities are among the main triggers for out-of-school children in primary school,” said Dr Oyewale. <img class="wp-image-613407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-33-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Unicef In her policy document, Primary and Secondary Education Minister Eveline Ndlovu said Government remains committed to ensuring that there is access to quality, inclusive, relevant and equitable education by all children in Zimbabwe as enshrined in the Constitution. “The Ministry’s key focus is thus to provide a sound foundation for the nation’s human capital development.
