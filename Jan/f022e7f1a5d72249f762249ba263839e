ZANU-PF National Political Commissar Cde Mike Bimha has urged party affiliates to work in harmony and not to view each other as rivals and separate entities as they all have a common goal – to push for economic development. Addressing party affiliates’ that included Farmers4ED, Young Women4ED, Rastas4ED, Artists4ED, Pastors4ED, Miners4ED, Mapostori 4ED, War Veterans Association and Teachers 4ED at Bulawayo’s Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre yesterday, Cde Bimha said the various groupings must formalise their operations. <img class="size-large wp-image-676735" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/erfre-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/erfre.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/erfre-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The party has witnessed a proliferation of organisations, coming in the form of economic development associations for President Mnangagwa. Yes, this is a good thing and it shows that the children of the nation are dedicated to his vision for economic development. “However, we want these organisations to be formalised. The formalisation of these organisations will help in maintaining order and show that our party is an orderly party,” he said. Cde Bimha said affiliates should be in a position to rope in new members to the ruling party instead of taking in already existing members. <img class="size-large wp-image-676624" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/yuhjmjm-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/yuhjmjm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/yuhjmjm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “With regards to the affiliates being behind economic development, they should be in a position to rope in new members to the ruling party so that they are also equally involved and participating in economic development. This goes hand in hand with the President’s vision of leaving no one and no place behind hence if affiliates are to fish members from within how would that have been developmental?” asked Cde Bimha. He said the ruling party is targeting to mobilise five million votes for President Mnangagwa and therefore the need to recruit new party members willing to work for the party to ensure a resounding victory in this year’s elections. Speaking during the same meeting, Zanu PF Bulawayo provincial chairperson, Cde Jabulani Sibanda said affiliates have the responsibility of mobilising votes for President Mnangagwa.  “As affiliates, you are advocating for support and empowerment on projects that you are embarking on, which have been supported by the President. “Our President is a listening one and for us to repay him for his works towards empowerment and strides for economic development, we need to repay him by voting for him and mobilising votes for him,” said Cde Sibanda. Doctors, Ancillary and Nurses for Economic Development (DAaN4ED) national deputy secretary general, Cde Trust Mphelo said the meeting of the affiliates was a welcome development. <img class="size-large wp-image-676621" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ferfeerg-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ferfeerg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ferfeerg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We appreciate the calling of such meetings by the ruling party which help give us a voice. It is through such meetings that we get recognition and our pleas are heard, and we call on the calling of more meetings,” he said. Ama2k for Economic Development Bulawayo provincial chairman, Cde Victor Ncube said the meeting will help them focus on their roles as affiliates and working toward a common goal. — @Sagepapie14
