The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief CHIEFS have hailed plans to introduce virtual courts in the Matabeleland region next month saying they will help rural folk have improved access to an effective justice system. People in the Matabeleland region will be able to access courts virtually starting on February 1 this year as part of efforts to enhance access to justice by the Judiciary Service Commission (JSC). The virtual court system will digitise the Labour Court and the Administrative Courts housed in Bulawayo. The virtual courts are being introduced as part of a programme called Integrated Electronic Case Management System (IECMS). The IECMS system is a web-based Case Management System that automates and tracks all aspects of a case life cycle, from initial filing through disposition and appeal. The system allows for information sharing between systems from all stakeholders in the judiciary. In the future, the system will integrate with the systems from organisations such as the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services, the Law Society of Zimbabwe, the Attorney General’s Office, the National Prosecuting Authority, the Legal Aid Directorate, and the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Court. This is in line with the Government’s policy to take the justice delivery system to the people in line with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). <img class="alignnone wp-image-480406 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Zimbabwe-Prisons-and-Correctional-Services.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Zimbabwe-Prisons-and-Correctional-Services.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Zimbabwe-Prisons-and-Correctional-Services-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services Chief Bango from Mangwe District said physical access to courts has remained a barrier for many in rural areas. “Centralisation of court processes has remained a hindrance for many people in the rural areas in accessing the justice system. Some people don’t have the resources to travel from the rural areas to Bulawayo to get services and they opt to forego seeking legal help even if they are in desperate need of it,” he said.  “Some people fail to make follow-ups on their cases due to travel costs. Some cases are dropped because of failure to travel to the courts. Virtual courts will be of great help in improving access to justice. A lot of people in rural areas now have smartphones and if they can go through some of the processes without leaving their homes it would be better. There will however be a need for improved network coverage in rural areas.” Chief Tshitshi from Mangwe District said virtual courts will help address corruption which has remained a thorn in the flesh. He said some people have lost faith in the justice system because of corruption from officials who are supposed to fight for justice. <img class="alignnone wp-image-541620 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Chief-Tshitshi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Chief-Tshitshi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Chief-Tshitshi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Tshitshi Chief Tshitshi said when justice is not served people come back to traditional leaders seeking their intervention. He said timeous completion of cases will also help to reduce corruption and restore people’s confidence in the justice system. “As traditional leaders, we are keen to see justice prevail so that there is sanity within the community. We always urge people to expose culprits but the challenge is that after they do that, some of the culprits are released because of corruption. We hope that the digital system will ensure transparency and accountability. Handling of dockets by different offices has proven to be detrimental to the justice system,” he said. Chief Masendu from Bulilima District said there is a need for communities to be educated on the new system so that they can fully benefit from it. He said there is a need for systems to be put in place so that as many people in rural areas as possible can access virtual courts. Chief Masendu said access to an effective justice system is a fundamental right of every citizen of the country. He said an effective system can help to fight crime. “If our country has an effective justice system then we will be able to tackle crime which is on the increase. The level of crime in our country is worrying as well as the increase in horrific crimes such as murder,” he said. With the IECMS system people anywhere in Matabeleland or Zimbabwe will have access to the courts virtually. Those in need of gadgets or data to access courts from their home will go to the nearest court as they will be connected for such purposes. With the IECMS, magistrates, and judges will be able to lead proceedings from their chambers and lawyers will have the option to attend court physically or do it from their offices. In terms of filing cases or submitting documents, users of the IECMS will be able to save these online for easy access Virtual courts will enhance justice and efficiency in the court system because matters that are filed will be dealt with instantly. The system will remove the human element that may interfere with processes. It also deals with perennial issues of corruption such as missing files and documents. –@DubeMatutu
