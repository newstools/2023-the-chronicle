The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has raised a concern over the high frequency of accidents occurring at rail-level crossing points and on tracks with three such incidences having been during the first week of this year. <img class="alignnone wp-image-478140 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/National-Railways-of-Zimbabwe-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/National-Railways-of-Zimbabwe-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/National-Railways-of-Zimbabwe--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  National-Railways-of-Zimbabwe Of the three, one was fatal after a man who was lying on the railway track at Deka Siding in Hwange was run over by a train on New Year’s Day in what is suspected to be a suicide  case. The other two incidences were recorded in Harare and Zvishavane. “The NRZ is concerned with the high frequency of accidents occurring on rail-level crossing points and on tracks despite repeated awareness campaigns. A few days into the New Year, three such accidents have already been recorded resulting in one fatality and a serious injury. “A light motor vehicle was damaged when the driver failed to give way to a train at the Kambuzuma Level Crossing in Harare. Fortunately, there were no injuries. “On New Year’s Day, a man lying on railway tracks was run over by a train at Deka Siding, Hwange in a case of suspected suicide. On 2 January, another male adult lost his leg after being hit by a train near Dorset in Zvishavane. He was taken to Gweru Provincial Hospital,” said the parastatal.  Despite numerous campaigns by NRZ in educating members of the public to be vigilant when approaching rail-level crossings especially when driving, the country continues to record injuries and fatalities on its rail  tracks. According to statistics, from 2019 to 2021, the country had 47 suspected suicide deaths while from January to August last year there were 38 suspected suicide deaths, a figure that was described as very disturbing by  NRZ. The increase in the number of accidents involving trains at level crossings prompted railway companies in the Southern Africa Development Community (Sadc) through the Southern African Railway Association (Sara) to set aside a week in October every year for public awareness campaigns on railway safety to curb accidents and  fatalities. <img class="alignnone wp-image-671873 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-19-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-19-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-19-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sara Last year, the NRZ joined other railway companies in commemorating the Sara railway safety week which ran from October 9 to October 14. The railway safety week is also meant to ensure that the region has joint regional advocacy for railway safety practices which conform to the Sadc/Sara railway safety  standards. Rail/road level crossings in the Sadc region have been scenes of horrific accidents as vehicle drivers ignore traffic rules and try to beat trains at the intersections. – @skhumoyo2000.
