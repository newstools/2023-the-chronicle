The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Chiefs have made an inquiry about the availability of former Tsholotsho FC and FC Platinum coach Lizwe Swewe in their bid to strengthen their technical team. Sweswe, who led FC Platinum to the 2019 Premier Soccer League title, is presently attached to Zifa Southern Region Division One Soccer League side Talen Vision. <img class="wp-image-670386 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-14-copy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-14-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-14-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Chiefs players Chiefs who resumed their preseason training on Monday under the guidance of goalkeepers’ trainer Nkosiyazi Sibanda and fitness trainer Abraham Mbayiwa who has since crossed the floor to Highlanders are hopeful of concluding a deal with their prospective coach by Tuesday. The club’s secretary Dumisani Mantula-Sibanda confirmed they have asked about Sweswe’s availability, stating that they have been negotiating with Portuguese coach Nilton Terroso who left the country before the season ended after his permit expired. “Our preseason proper starts next week. This week, members of the technical team were looking at some players who were seconded to the club and might join the seniors when the coach starts his programme next week. Our hope is that by Tuesday, we should have concluded negotiations with the coach or coaches. As it is, we’ve been engaged in talks with Nilton and we did inquire about Sweswe as well as some local coaches. If you call on Tuesday, we should be able to give you more details,” said Mantula-Sibanda.  Terroso’s permit expired on October 4 last year, leaving Thulani Sibanda, Ncube and Mbayiwa in charge of the team that went on to lift the Chibuku Super Cup with a 1-0 triumph over Herentals in the final.
Bulawayo Chiefs continued to pay Terroso whose contract expired on December 31, with the Portuguese reportedly providing training programmes and plans for the matches in liaison with the technical team. The Portuguese left the club on position eight on the table with 42 points from 29 games, and Amakhosi Amahle went on to finish the season seventh with 49 points, the best they have ever achieved since they made their maiden dance in the PSL in 2018. <img class="wp-image-631996 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chibuku-Super-Cup.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chibuku-Super-Cup.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Chibuku-Super-Cup-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chibuku Super Cup Thulani has since left the club having been appointed head coach for Triangle United.
Mantula-Sibanda could not be drawn into commenting on whether Sweswe, if hired was coming in to understudy Terroso or they were targeting the championship winning gaffer for the head coach’s position.
Sweswe confirmed getting a call from Bulawayo Chiefs. “I’m attached to Talen Vision and right now we’re planning for the new season. It’ true that they (Bulawayo Chiefs) called wanting to find out about my status. Today (yesterday) I’m meeting the boys (Talen Vision players) to brief them about the pre-season,” said Sweswe. Meanwhile, Bulawayo Chiefs’ key players in the 2021/22 season have been watching the trialists going through their paces at their Chiefs Village. Among players from last season’s squad who are expected to start training next week to prepare for the Castle Challenge Cup against FC platinum are skipper Marlin Mkolo, Felix Moyo, Mthokozisi Msebe, Obriel Chirinda, Ben Nyahunzwi, Matripples Muleya and Lexington Mujokoro. — @ZililoR
