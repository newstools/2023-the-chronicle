Ass Insp Nyathi added that the copper wire was stolen at the 41 km peg along Harare – Bulawayo railway line. Possession of copper cables without a valid licence now attracts a mandatory 10-year prison sentence without the option of a fine under new regulations meant to deter vandalism of key utilities. The Copper Control Amendment Act has been amended to raise the minimum sentence for illegal possession of copper from two years to a mandatory 10 years. According to the new Act, it is now mandatory for all copper dealers to have certificates of origin for the metal in their possession. @Sagepapie14
