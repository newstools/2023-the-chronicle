The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MANDLA “Lulu” Mpofu’s Masitaoka Football Club had to dig deep into their bag of tricks to come from a goal down and win their Botswana Premiership match against Philani “Beefy” Ncube’s Nico United at Molepolole Sports Complex. The two Zimbabwean coaches faced each other for the first time in Botswana since moving to the neighbouring country at the start of the 2022/23 season in August last year. <img class="size-large wp-image-673421" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/iouiy78tyu-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/iouiy78tyu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/iouiy78tyu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Philani Ncube Nico United Familiar with each other’s tactics having faced off a number of times in the Zimbabwean Premiership, the duo took their fight to Botswana where Ncube’s Nico United took a first half lead through an own goal by a Masitaoka defender.
Itumeleng Salani equalised three minutes into the second half before Lethabo Ogotseng got the winner in additional time. The victory took Masitaoka’s points tally to 19 in 11 games. They are sixth on the table, trailing leaders Gaborone United who edged Rahman Gumbo’s Morupole Wanderers 1-0 by 10 points.
An ecstatic Mpofu praised his charges for fighting back to claim three points. “It was a difficult game as two home boys clashed. We know each other in terms of strategy and playing style and to win the game against my fellow countryman in the foreign land wasn’t easy. Nico United were tough opponents as they took a first half lead. We managed to chase the game and dug deep to get the winner in injury time.
“I’m proud of my boys because they are pushing themselves to the limit.  This win takes off pressure from the boy and builds their confidence as we move forward. Our goal is to have these young players gaining experience as we fight to survive relegation while guiding these youngsters,” Mpofu said.
With an average age of 22 years, Masitaoka have signed former Bulawayo City striker Jacob Mloyi (22). The forward is waiting for his permit. “Jacob gives us another striking dimension. He fits well with the vision of the club which is using young players. We hope to have him available for selection when we play Morupule Wanderers in two weeks’ time,” Mpofu said.
Mloyi will join 19-year-old Zimbabwean winger Simba Manyoni who played for Surrey FC from the Zifa Eastern Region before moving to Botswana. Meanwhile, Ncube said failure to convert scoring opportunities cost them maximum points.
“I think we dominated for the better part of the game but we were not lucky at the end of the day. Sometimes you need luck in football. We need to start converting our chances. The boys still lacks composure,” Ncube said. <img class="wp-image-673419 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/khjh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/khjh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/khjh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Masitaoka Football Club against Nico United Nico United have averaged a point per game this season, eleventh on the log with 11 points after 11 games.
