The Chronicle Angela Sibanda, Showbiz Correspondent After 10 years of operating on the streets and staging shows at different venues in Bulawayo, Umahlekisa Comedy Club has decided to look for a permanent venue. The crew, under the leadership of Ntando Van Moyo will from this weekend, go on a quest to find a permanent base from where they will host their weekly shows. The search is expected to begin on Saturday at Phumulani Beer Garden in Pumula North where an event will be held. Fans of the comedy club are expected to gather there to determine whether the place is ideal for the club through voting. From there, the club will stage shows at other venues until they get the ideal place.  According to the crew, they are looking for a spot where people will be able to gather and enjoy music, food and art in its many forms. “The new venue will serve as a hunting ground for new talent as well as a space to promote local art and businesses. Female comedians will also be nurtured with local artistes being supported. We’re also hoping that this will help boost our annual comedy festival when the year ends,” said Van Moyo. He said the search is expected to stretch up to about April. “We’ll be going around hosting events at joints that have been inviting us or popping up in our spaces,” said Van Moyo. “Our audiences have been given the task to vote for the place which they feel will be best for our activities. This will be done through questionnaires that we’ve come up with.” <img class="wp-image-546559 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Ntando-Van-Moyo-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Ntando-Van-Moyo-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Ntando-Van-Moyo-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Umahlekisa Comedy Club director Ntando Van Moyo He said the club will be celebrating its 10th anniversary on March 30 and they hope that by then, they will have secured a venue. “We’re planning to host a massive comedy celebration for our anniversary and we’re hoping that we’ll have settled at our new home by April,” Van Moyo said.
