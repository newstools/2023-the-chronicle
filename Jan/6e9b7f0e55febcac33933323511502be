The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS Football Club followers should brace for changes to the technical team for the upcoming season, the club has revealed. In his report to Bosso members on Sunday during the club’s Annual General Meeting, exective committee chairman Johnfat Sibanda said they were in the process of making changes to their technical structure. “In preparation for the new season, we are also in the process of restructuring our technical setup in line with the club’s strategic direction as well as modern dictates of our football environment,” said Sibanda. While he did not go into detail, Zifa has said they are on a path to fully implement club licencing, with standardisation of coaches topping the list as they want qualified coaches on the bench.  Sources within Highlanders say Joel Luphahla will either be registered as a kit manager or welfare manager as he is not qualified to sit on the technical bench as an assistant coach. Vezigama Dlodlo is Highlanders’ welfare manager, but indications are that he likely to be reassigned to head the juniors. However, some club members had reservations on the setting up of the technical structure. They questioned why the club has chosen to keep Luphahla yet they are fully aware he is not qualified to sit on the bench as assistant coach. Luphahla is a Caf C holder and head coaches in the Premier Soccer League as well as their assistants are required to have Caf A. Those in support of Bosso keeping Luphahla argue that the former Warriors winger did not misrepresent his qualifications when Bosso took him away from Golden Eagles last year and point to the financial implications should Bosso decide to fire him since they have to pay him for the remaining months of his deal. Former Highlanders utility player Abraham Mbaiwa is part of the Bosso pre-season preparations after replacing Harold Nhachi as the fitness trainer. <img class="wp-image-568718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Abraham-Mbaiwa-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Abraham-Mbaiwa-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Abraham-Mbaiwa-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Abraham Mbaiwa Before the arrival of Mbaiwa, there were even talks of registering Antonio Torres as the fitness trainer because he has those qualifications. Some members also urged the executive to ensure that the club gets players from its development system and only buy a player if they have exceptional talent. – @innocentskizoe
