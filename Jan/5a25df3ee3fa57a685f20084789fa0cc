The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Reporter DRIVING down George Silundika Street in Bulawayo’s city centre, it is difficult to miss the squad of youths, armed with mutton cloth, soap and buckets full of water that usually gather at the 9th Avenue corner waiting for motorists to drive in their cars for a wash. Many drivers seek their services despite the fact that washing the cars on the streets is illegal.
The youth argue that although unregistered, they are the most faithful, reliable and hardworking individuals involved in the business of car washing. They say they have been operating at this section of the street since 2016.
Some motorists are however reluctant to engage these youths for fear of losing their valuables but the youths are saying they have taken measures to ensure thieves are removed from their midst. Their business like others, was hit hard by council’s new parking system that has seen many motorists moving away from streets where they pay parking fees. <img class="size-large wp-image-640635" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-22-10-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-22-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-22-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> car wash Mthabisi Nkomo (27) who preferred to be called Mtha from Old Pumula suburb said he has been in the business since 2016. “I started washing cars seven years ago near Watering Hole but we had many conflicts with council officials which saw us relocating to the next street. Since then, we have been washing cars here,” said Mtha. He said they go all out to persuade motorists to engage them to wash their cars.
“I live with my unemployed sister who has three children and as their sole breadwinner, I just have to work hard to ensure they have food, shelter and everything. One thing that has kept the business alive is the relationship I have with my clients. I have been washing cars for the same people for the past seven years,” said Mtha. He said faithfulness is key as some people involved in car washing business are infamous for stealing from clients.
Clients pay US$3 to US$5 depending on the service that they require. “TTI really affected our business, we lost quite a number of clients who cannot afford to pay our charges and parking fees. We only survive because we have loyal clients who have been following us from where we were, I have customers who have continued to bring their cars to me because of the relationship that we have created over time. <img class="size-large wp-image-667930" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/sdvsfwe-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/sdvsfwe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/sdvsfwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Car wash “I have never stolen anything from my clients and sometimes I feel like they set up traps to test me by deliberately leaving money in their cars. I do not take even coins or sweets or anything I always declare and over time I have gained their trust. My clients sometimes leave a lot of money in their cars knowing that they will find everything intact, I mean character is everything and that is how I get business.” Mtha said he has also tried training fellow youngsters from Pumula but many do not last as they steal. “I usually invite one or two to come to help me clean the cars and I ask simple questions like what would one do in case they find a coin or US$1 lying around inside a client’s car. I also love what I do and over time have mastered the art of thoroughly cleaning cars in and out within an hour, which has helped me, especially now that parking is charged per hour.” For Mgcini Ncube who stays in Cowdray Park suburb, washing cars on the street is just a stepping stone as he wishes to run a registered car wash one day. He said proceeds from his business help him take care of his grandmother and two siblings who look up to him for upkeep.  “It is so easy to get carried away because we make money daily on a good day. We can even raise US$20 to US$30 and if one is not careful they can squander it on beer and pleasing fake friends. I have, however, decided that whatever I make daily I must save even US$1 towards my future because I won’t be washing cars forever,” he said. “I started off in 2016 with Mtha and yes I have managed to take care of my family with the earnings, I can afford to buy myself clothes and toiletries without having to steal or beg. “I wish to start my own business one day or even venture into public transport so that I live a better life.”
Ncube added that customer care is key hence the need to provide quality service. “I sometimes think we do better than car washing companies hence clients come to us. We have some who are willing to pay extra for our services despite TTI. We lost clientele because TTI parking fees are too high,” he said.
Ncube said it is important to complete the work in an hour or less so that clients do not pay more for parking. “Some of my clients leave money in their cars because they know that I do not steal. We always encourage each other to refrain from stealing,” he said. Leon Ndlovu popularly known as Mkaradi from Sauerstown suburb said he had been washing cars for the past five years.
“I live with my grandmother whom I am helping. I make enough money to meet most of my basics,” he said. — @thamamoe.
