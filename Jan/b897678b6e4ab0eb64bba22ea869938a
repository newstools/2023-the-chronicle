The Chronicle The Zimpapers group’s Kwayedza newspaper has launched a new baby titled ‘Kwayedza Dzidza’ which will solely publish educative content for school-going children. In an interview, the public relations and communications manager Pauline Matanda said the new publication had been necessitated by public demand. “We have finally listened to market demands, the market had been asking for a specialised newspaper focusing on education but as Zimpapers we thought we should start with Shona and that is why we have brought Kwayedza Dzidza on board. “According to the statistics we are getting, children are struggling when it comes to local languages,” she said. Mrs Matanda called on Government and relevant stakeholders to support the initiative which would go a long way in educating school-going children. “This paper will carry educational content only and we are encouraging all stakeholders in the sector to come on board and support this product, from school children, parents, teachers as well as schools. “The paper carries content for ECD up to A’ level students. “I am sure you are aware that parents and guardians have been struggling when it comes to assisting children with homework; There is this popular saying circulating on social media “Chimwe chichatiuraya takavarairwa ihomework” especially Shona; Kwayedza Dzidza is there to fill the gap,” she said For more information, please contact: Pauline Matanda – Public Relations Herald House Harare Tel: 04-708296-9 Ext 1390 E-mail: pauline.matanda@zimpapers.co.zw
