The Chronicle Chronicle  Reporter A 48-YEAR-OLD woman from Bulawayo’s Mpopoma suburb who has spent seven months bedridden is appealing for assistance to undergo tests to ascertain the cause of her medical problems. Ms Samukeliso Mpala who arrived in Bulawayo last year in June from her matrimonial home in Zvishavane after relatives offered to take her to a hospital, is struggling to eat due to a throat infection. Although she spent the whole of June going to the hospital, healthcare workers failed to help her resulting in her condition deteriorating. After two months, a tube was inserted to help her eat since she has a throat infection which has made it impossible for her to swallow food. When Chronicle visited Ms Mpala yesterday, the news crew observed that the woman had been reduced to a bony figure. She could barely talk and her granddaughter, Ms Cynthia Maticha who lives nearby said the family has exhausted all the funds in trying to get medical help. “Her situation worsens with each passing day and right now she cannot even talk. We are not sure what exactly the problem is,” she said. Ms Maticha said her grandmother fell sick last year, which prompted them to move her to Bulawayo with the hope that she would get better treatment.  “The challenge is that she hasn’t walked, sat upright, or eaten properly since then and you can tell that she is in immense pain. The last time we went to Mpilo Central Hospital, they suspected cancer and gave us a list of tests that should be conducted, with the cheapest going for US$250,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-605607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Maticha said the family is struggling to make ends meet and can no longer afford to take her back to her matrimonial home in Zvishavane. “We need help because whatever is affecting my grandmother is spreading, but we cannot do anything because we have no money. We need a minimum of US$250 for tests, food, medication and transport,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-482709 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Medicines-and-medical-sundries.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Medicines-and-medical-sundries.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Medicines-and-medical-sundries-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> medication Ms Maticha said well-wishers can contact her on 0719792240 or visit Block 56/1722 in Mpopoma suburb.
