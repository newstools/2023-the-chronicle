The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau VILLAGERS in Malibeng area in Beitbridge District, Matabeleland South have pooled resources to replace the rooftops of a classroom block and a teachers’ cottage at the local primary school which were recently blown off by heavy rains. Recently, heavy rains preceded by strong winds and thunderstorms also claimed a life of an 80-year-old man in Gwanda District and left a trail of destruction in some parts of Matabeleland South Province. <img class="wp-image-673862 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/qaszdz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/qaszdz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/qaszdz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> School Development Committee The destruction of the school infrastructure forced learners to share a classroom while teachers were also affected.
Malibeng Primary School has 196 learners.
The chairperson of the School Development Committee (SDC), Mr Musa Dube said the damages were recorded last week. “Following the destruction of the classroom block and teachers’ cottage, we sat down as stakeholders and decided to mobilise resources to fix the damaged roof. We asked every family to contribute R200 for the procurement of new roofing material,” he said.
Mr Dube said some of the infrastructure at the school is now old and needs to be replaced to minimise future disasters.  A community leader in the area, Mr Thando Ndlovu said: “We have taken it upon ourselves to be proactive and we are appealing for more support. We are getting money collected from members of the community by our seven village heads.”
Ms Lehlohonolo Nare said everyone in the area had shown commitment in the project. She said their long-term plan is to contribute towards the construction of more classroom blocks and houses for the teaching staff. Another villager, Mrs Petty Moyo said they decided to swiftly repair the roof to minimise overcrowding at the school.
“We are doing our best to minimise the effects of the damages and everyone is contributing in cash and kind to repair the roofs,” she said. <img class="wp-image-673857 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tydcghchj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tydcghchj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/tydcghchj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge West MP Cde Ruth Maboyi Ncube The school has a staff complement of seven teachers including the headmaster.
Beitbridge West MP Cde Ruth Maboyi Ncube, who is also the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, on Monday visited the area to assess the damage. “We had a very unfortunate incident in this area and we have noted that this community is proactive. While they wait for help to come, the members of the community have also come up with a plan to address their children’s immediate needs,” she said. “I, therefore, urge the Civil Protection Committee and other stakeholders, especially luminaries from this area to assist the villagers to rebuild the school”.
Cde Maboyi said there is a compelling need for people to collaborate and find solutions to some of the challenges within communities. — @tupeyo
