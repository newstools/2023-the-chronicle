The Chronicle Canditar Chapanduka, Chronicle Reporter A 23-YEAR-OLD Bulawayo youth is basking in the glory of a flourishing farming story after turning her backyard garage into a garden where he grows mushrooms. Mr Thandolwenkosi Moyo (23) of Richmond suburb has been into mushroom farming for the past nine months and has since registered a company called Purcha Investments. He grows the oyster mushroom type, which is easy to manage because it does not require air conditioned facilities. Mr Moyo said his company, Purcha Investments, is one of the thriving mushroom producers in the city supplying supermarkets, restaurants, and individuals.  Mushrooms are a rich, low-calorie source of fibre, protein and antioxidants. According to nutritional health sources, they may also mitigate the risk of developing serious health conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and diabetes. The mushrooms boast many health benefits. They are high in folic acid, fibre, protein, and vitamins B1, B3, B5, and B12, as well as iron, zinc, potassium, phosphorus and selenium. Mr Moyo said he was assisted by a non-governmental organisation called Global Humanitarian and Trust (GHAT) to start the mushroom production company. <img class="wp-image-677417 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-63-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-63-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-63-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Participants at a mushroom training workshop in Richmond, Bulawayo, yesterday “I have managed to pay school fees for myself. I am a student at the Bindura University of Science Education studying Biomedical Science and through the proceeds from my business, I am taking care of myself,” he said. “Mushroom production is a profitable business because from only 50 bags of mushrooms, I am able to cater for all my needs.” Mr Moyo started with 50 bags of mushrooms and today he has over 3 000 bags. “Mushrooms come in different types and for now, I was producing the oyster mushroom type because it is cheap and less demanding. Soon, I intend venturing into producing button mushrooms because they are scarce in the market and they are also in huge demand,” he said. “Mushrooms are rich in protein and also help reduce chances of contracting some deadly diseases such cancer and diabetes.” Mr Moyo said mushrooms grow overnight in large clusters. “For an individual to start a mushroom business they need something like US$120 to buy seeds and equipment to set up a structure and there are good returns,” he said. Mr Moyo said mushrooms take at least three weeks to mature and what comes from each seed can be harvested for almost three months He said mushroom farming requires a high standard of hygiene and the room where they are kept needs to be kept clean and moist. “However, the challenge that I’m facing is load shedding and water rationing. Mushrooms need water and the water rationing affects our production. I have just started button mushroom production which requires electricity due to the air conditioning facilities,” said Mr Moyo. Mr Moyo has have trained more than 150 individuals on how to produce mushrooms. “The demand for mushrooms is high yet the supply is low so I have been training people so that we can work together in the industry,” he said. Mr Moyo has employed employ four people who are all degree holders. GHAT chief executive officer Mr Munyaradzi Charuka said Mr Moyo is one of the many youths they have helped to start business. <img class="wp-image-676926 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/qsdwd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/qsdwd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/qsdwd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mushroom training Munyaradzi Charuka..CEO of Global humanitarian and trust (GHAT) “We helped Moyo as an organisation with funds to start his business and he is passionate about the business.
