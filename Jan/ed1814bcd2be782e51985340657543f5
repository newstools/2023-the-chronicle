THE Civil Protection Unit (CPU) has warned the public to be alert of potential hazards that may occur as a result of heavy rains, which are expected across the country up to Sunday. The public is warned that run-off up to 30cm deep can sweep away vehicles hence citizens should avoid crossing flooded rivers. Some parts of the country have recorded heavy rains in the past few days.  In a daily weather update, the Meteorological Service Department (MSD) yesterday warned that the expected rains may result in localised flooding. The Ministry of Local Government and Public Works also said it has activated disaster response mechanisms across the country. “The Department of Civil Protection is urging citizens to be on high alert of forecasted torrential rains from Friday 6 through Sunday January 8, 2023 across the country,” it said. “We also call on all relevant stakeholders and traditional leaders to find ways to disseminate the information to their various communities in particular all Mashonaland, Manicaland, parts of the Midlands and Masvingo provinces where heavy rains in excess of 65mm are expected in 24-hours,” reads the statement. <img class="wp-image-590221 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/rains-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/rains-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/rains-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rains The ministry said members of the public should follow weather updates to be informed on ongoing weather events. “Citizens should be on the watch for possible flooding, avoid crossing flooded rivers/streams and stay indoors during the period as the heavy rains may reduce visibility for motorists. District Civil Protection Committees countrywide have been mobilised,” it said. Meanwhile, MSD said heavy rains were recorded in places such as Bulawayo, which recorded 93mm of rainfall within 24 hours followed by Rusape with 42mm, Kwekwe 32mm and Marondera (28mm). “More insolation is occurring even in the northern areas as clouds are breaking; coupled with this, more moisture is approaching in the form of a cloud band from the west (in Botswana currently),” said MSD. It said today areas such as Matabeleland South, Masvingo, southern areas of Midlands, southern parts of Midlands should be sunny and mild at first, becoming hot and humid by midday. <img class="alignnone wp-image-509361 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Thunderstorm.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Thunderstorm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Thunderstorm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> MSD said Matabeleland North among other parts of the country are expected to receive heavy rains today. “Isolated thunderstorms and brief cloudy periods are expected to spread from the west into all these areas. Matabeleland North, Bulawayo Metropolitan, northern districts of Midlands, Harare Metropolitan, northern parts of Manicaland, and all Mashonaland Provinces are anticipated to be mostly cloudy with light morning rain and afternoon thundershowers.
