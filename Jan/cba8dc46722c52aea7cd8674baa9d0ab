The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter A VICTORIA Falls man will live to regret the day he decided to steal a car for a joyride and boozing spree on Christmas Day after he was involved in an accident that left him hospitalised. Thulani Tshuma (22) of Chinotimba is not a licensed driver.
He allegedly found a Toyota Vitz belonging to Mr Gilbert Mthokozisi Nkomo who is a clearing agent parked near Chicken Inn restaurant at night and broke a window to gain entry. Mr Nkomo was drinking at a nightclub across the road.
After driving less than two kilometres along Park Way towards Army Chalets, Tshuma lost control of the vehicle resulting in it overturning and landing on its roof.  Tshuma was not asked to plead to driving without a valid drivers’ licence, negligent driving and malicious damage to property when he appeared before Victoria Falls resident magistrate Mr Godswill Mavenge. He was remanded in custody to 11 January and is scheduled to appear at the Hwange regional court for a possible start of trial.
Prosecuting Ms Audrey Mukanganya said after stealing the car and getting involved in an accident, Tshuma abandoned the vehicle and walked to the nearest council water treatment plant where he was found in the morning lying on the ground at the gate. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-628030" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/accident-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/accident-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/accident-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “On 26 December the complainant parked his motor vehicle, a Toyota Vitz at a car park opposite Chicken Inn and locked the doors before entering a nightclub,” said Ms Mukanganya.
