Answer: Helen is a 21-year-old musician and mental health advocate. My full name is Tadiwa Helen Nyati. I was born and bred in Luveve 5, Bulawayo and based in Harare. I went to Mckeurtan Primary School and Njube High School. Q: Wounded Soldier, who did you work with and what inspired the song?
A: I worked with Mutual Beatz (beat maker) and Dr Breezy who mixed and mastered the song. The song was inspired by a relationship that I once experienced. Apart from my personal experience, I feel that the song relates to everyone who has been hurt and broken, but managed to rise and move forward. Q: What made you venture into music?
A: I have always been passionate about music. My dad figured it out and it so happened that he knew Cal_Vin (the late) as he taught him in high school. We also happened to stay in the same area (Luveve). My dad introduced me to Cal_Vin and that’s when it all began. I got the push that I needed from these two as well as international artistes that I listened to. <img class="size-large wp-image-516383" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Calvin-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Calvin.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Calvin-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Calvin Q: What challenges do you face in this male-dominated industry?
A: It’s very easy to be taken advantage of in this male-dominated industry. You get promised a lot of things and if you lose focus and don’t respect yourself enough, you will be left to suffer. So working with men sometimes is hard (it’s a challenge), you just have to know who to work with and only those that mean business. Q: Do you think artistes should depend on promoters to book them for shows or they should start organising their own events?
A: I think depending on promoters is not quite a good idea. Artistes should start organising their own events and make money from them. How long are we as artistes going to wait for promoters to show up and be our saviours? Q: Any advice to up-and-coming artistes?
A: There’s always a bright light ahead, a path worth taking without losing yourself. Hard work pays and always remember that nothing comes easy. Just be careful of the people you call your friends in the industry and focus on what matters.
