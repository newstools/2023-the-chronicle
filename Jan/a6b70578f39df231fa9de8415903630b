In a statement yesterday, Zimsec board chairperson Professor Eddie Mwenje said candidates can now access their results through the examination body website.  “Candidates are advised to click on their respective region where they will be redirected to the portal on which they can access their results. The portal will be opened for five days only. Heads of examination centres will be able to collect the results for their respective schools/centres from our regional offices on Monday, 16 January, 2022,” he said. Prof Mwenje attributed the improved performance to, among other factors, the restoration of the normal school calendar, which resulted in learners adequately preparing for their examinations. The prolonged Covid-19-induced closure of schools for the better of 2020 and 2021, has been blamed for the pupils’ poor performance in public examinations in 2021. “At this juncture, it is imperative to remind all candidates, parents, and stakeholders that the Cala component is integral to the candidates’ learning and assessment. Candidates who did not submit their Calas are considered to have not completed their assessment, therefore, they will not be receiving results,” said Prof Mwenje. “This policy position was communicated extensively from the onset by the parent Ministry and Zimsec.” According to Zimsec, from the school candidates who sat for the 2022 examinations, a total of 30 895 wrote two or more subjects with 27 747 obtaining Grade E or better, yielding a pass rate of 98,81 percent, compared to a pass rate of 86, 89 percent from the 40 599 candidates who sat for the 2021 exams. <img class="wp-image-599311 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZIMSEC.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZIMSEC.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ZIMSEC-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimsec There was a 5,78 percent increase in pass rate from the 5 857 private candidates with 5 490 obtaining Grade E or better, translating to 77,83 percent, up from 72, 05 in 2021.
