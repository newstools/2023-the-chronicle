The Chronicle Tafadzwa Chibukwa, Chronicle Reporter Zanu-PF Bulawayo provincial chairman, Cde Jabulani Sibanda yesterday called on society to recognise the great work done by health workers. He was speaking after Cde Raj Modi, the Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce and Member of Parliament for Bulawayo South constituency donated US$5 000 to St Francis Children’s Home. St Francis children’s home, which is an annex of Ingutsheni Central Hospital is a sanctuary for children who are mentally challenged and some have severe physical handicaps. Many of them are bedridden while others use wheelchairs.
The home accommodates 60 children and has nursing facilities. <img class="size-large wp-image-669480" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/iii-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/iii.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/iii-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Modi donates to St. Francis home Cde Sibanda said doctors, nurses and all health workers play a critical role in society and they deserve recognition.
He said workers at St Francis were very dedicated hence were looking after the children well despite their challenges. “It is quite bad that as a society we do not recognise the efforts and work of nurses and doctors at our clinics and hospitals. We overlook the challenges they deal with daily. These people deserve better recognition and acknowledgement for their work,” said Cde Sibanda..
He said the oneness and humility of the staff at St Francis Children’s home must be emulated by all workers. Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube concurred with Cde Sibanda.
“It is quite refreshing to know that we still have medical personnel with good hearts that are dedicated to their work. These people are committed to caring for children, some of whom, have been abandoned by families,” she said. <img class="size-large wp-image-669484" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-48-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-48.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-48-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Modi donates to St. Francis home Minister Ncube commended Cde Modi for assisting the home.
“We greatly appreciate Cde Modi’s donation which will go a long way in assisting the children. We need as people of Bulawayo and the nation at large to develop a sense of responsibility for those around us in society. We need to work together to assist the vulnerable in our communities. It is quite heart-warming to know that there are still people who are generous like Cde Modi,” she said . <img class="size-large wp-image-669498" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-74-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-74.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-74-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Modi donates to St. Francis home Ingutsheni Central Hospital Clinical Director, Dr Wellington Ranga thanked Cde Modi.
“We truly appreciate the donation but this is not the first donation from Cde Modi as he has on several occassions assisted the home. Last year Cde Modi made a donation which lasted us the whole year and he has pledged to do the same annually which is appreciated,” he said. Cde Modi said by donating to the home, he was giving back to the community which has supported his businesses over the years. — @Sagepapie14.
