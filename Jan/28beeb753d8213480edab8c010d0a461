A BUSINESSMAN who allegedly killed seven people in a knife and spear rampage in Redcliff in 2021 has been indicted to the High Court and will appear before Justice Martin Makonese when the Gweru High Court Circuit sits next week Monday. Thubelihle Kheshow (26) in a shocking incident allegedly went berserk and struck seven neighbours with a spear to death and injured five others. Starting Monday, the Bulawayo High Court will be on a circuit in Gweru for two weeks.
Midlands provincial prosecutor Mr Samuel Pedzisayi said 17 murder cases including Kheshow’s matter will be heard.
From those murder cases, most of them involve artisanal gold miners, who engaged in deadly fights over gold claims and crimes of passion. <img class="wp-image-503722 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Justice-Martin-Makonese.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Justice-Martin-Makonese.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Justice-Martin-Makonese-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Justice Martin Makonese “The first term of the Bulawayo High Court Circuit for the Midlands Province is starting Monday, January 23 and 17 cases will be heard before High Court judge Justice Martin Makonese.

At the shrine, he allegedly turned violent, uprooted trees and started pushing stationary vehicles.
Kheshow was subdued by church congregants who then tied him with ropes. The following morning at around 2 am, while other church members were still asleep, Kheshow woke up and set himself free, got into his car and drove to his house. Upon arrival, he found his wife, Nothando Sibindi (25), absent and armed himself with three spears, an axe, a kitchen knife and a hoe handle. He then proceeded to his wife’s sister Nemakosi Sibindi’s residence.  He smashed the front dining room of his sister-in-law’s door to gain entry.
Sensing danger, Nemakosi escaped through the bedroom window leaving her five children sleeping in the room.
Kheshow savagely attacked the minors using the weapons and left them unconscious. Nemakosi later returned and discovered the gory scene and rushed them to a neighbour’s house to seek refuge and assistance. Some residents organised an ambulance to ferry the children to the hospital.
As members of the community mobilised for help, Kheshow emerged and allegedly attacked Kwiridzanai and stabbed her twice on the back using a sharp object. <img class="wp-image-607596 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-40-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kwekwe General Hospital The accused then proceeded to a house in Redcliff where he jumped over the security wall, smashed the kitchen door and forced entry into the bedroom where he stabbed Mercy Savanhu (33) twice on the chest and once on the head using a sharp object. He further hit Xolani Sikwili (33) with a hoe handle on the head and stabbed him with an unknown sharp object on the neck leading to his death. The accused stabbed Lareto Skwilli (7 months) on the head and chest with a sharp object.
Kheshow returned to his residence and stabbed Lina Moyo (56) and Meggie Nkiwane (85) and they died on the spot.
Nkiwane was the biological mother to Lina. <img class="alignnone wp-image-482836 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/kitchen-knife.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/kitchen-knife.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/kitchen-knife-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kheshow also allegedly raped one of the complainants.
