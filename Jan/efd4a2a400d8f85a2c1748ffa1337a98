The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Feature WHEN Reverend Joel Maphosa formed Insindiso YaMaNazaretha, a Zionist gospel outfit in 2003, his vision was to create a legacy for his family through music. The group comprised family members namely Rev Maphosa, his brother Mhlengi and sisters Sihle, Amkela and Anna. Rev Maphosa is, however, now late following his sudden death at the age of 45 on May 24, 2020, due to hypertension. His wife Thabiso Moyo and Patience Ncube, who was married to a nephew to the Maphosa completed the list on the line-up of the group whose sweet melodies are popular among many and sung even at funerals and prayer vigils. Insindiso YaMaNazaretha has become a household name in Zimbabwe, especially in the southern parts of the country, South Africa, and Botswana. The group has 15 albums to date. Before his death, Rev Maphosa in 2014 started Abantwana Bensindiso, an all-female off-shoot of Insindiso YaMaNazaretha, the main group, as a way of empowering women in the group. It was led by Rev Maphosa’s sisters who left upon getting married, leaving Thabiso and Ncube to lead the group. <img class="wp-image-671371 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-6-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-6-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-6-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thabiso Moyo, wife to the late Rev Joel Maphosa of Insindiso YamaNazaretha with Abantwana BaMaNazaretha in action Despite Rev Maphosa’s death, Insindiso YaMaNazaretha’s legacy lives on through his wife Thabiso who fronts Abantwana Bensindiso and collaborates with Mhlengi on the main group. Rev Maphosa and Thabiso had three children namely Nozithelo (12), Elizabeth (8) and Emmanuel (4). Ncube requested to leave Insindiso YaMaNazaretha and now leads her own stable under the name Mazilankatha, whose music also resembles the Insindiso YamaNazaretha touch. Thabiso leads Abantwana Bensindiso with her daughter Nozithelo and other teenage girls including Bridget Moyo, Princess Hluphe, Martha Moyo and Nobukhosi Ndiweni. Thabiso, her children and group are based in Bulawayo where they perform at various events while Mhlengi is based in South Africa. They collaborate whenever there is a gig for Insindiso YaMaNazaretha. Some groups disappear into thin air whenever the founder dies. In other instances, the remaining members fight over positions and proceeds which results in the demise of the group. But Insindiso YaMaNazaretha has remained steadfast in its mission to spread the Good News. Chronicle recently caught up with Thabiso who was performing with Abantwana Bensindiso at a function in Bulawayo. She said she misses her husband and has committed to continue with his legacy to keep his name alive. Rev Maphosa was the founder and pastor at The Nations Apostolic in Nazareth Church of Zion with branches in Njube and South Africa. “We’re still together. The aunts got married while uncane (brother-in-law) is in South Africa but we still sing together as Insindiso. Seeing that Insindiso is led by males, I opted to lead Abantwana Bensindiso. “The late Rev Maphosa started Abantwana Bensindiso which was then led by aunty Anna and Mazilankatha. So I started leading Abantwana Bensindiso before his death and we have four albums,” said Thabiso. Mazilankatha went solo in 2017.  Rev Maphosa hailed from Mambale, in Matabeleland South province, and started his music career selling CDs from the boot of a car on the streets of Bulawayo. Thabiso continues to sell their music on the streets in Bulawayo and says using memory sticks helps reduce piracy. She said the late Rev Maphosa had a mission to preach the word of God through music. He had no formal job and survived on selling his music on the streets. “Music was his gift. He was not after money; his mission was to evangelise. He started by opening a church; the majority of members were his family and relatives, which is how the group ended up having family members. There were some non-family members but they left,” said Thabiso. The Nations Apostolic in Nazareth congregation is still there with Mhlengi as one of the pastors. Thabiso encouraged gospel singers to be guided by God’s word and not be after money. She said life has not been good for her and her children since the death of her husband but she continues to soldier on. “Things are not well for me and my children. As a single mother, my children look up to me and I have to work hard and pretend all is well for their sake. I have committed myself to continue with music so that I raise them and I am happy that the family has not abandoned us,” she said. “My husband had worked hard in terms of music and many people play Insindiso music in their cars and at home. So to other gospel musicians, I want to say let’s not do it for money, let’s be spiritual and turn people to God.” Abantwana Bensindiso perform at weddings, parties, and other occasions where they play Insindiso YaMaNazaretha songs. Insindiso YaMaNazaretha’s first album in 2003 was Izulu Elitsha and the last album was Remember Me in 2019. Thabiso said that after Rev Maphosa’s death, she started understanding the message in the last album where he was bidding farewell to his loved ones. — @ncubeleon.
