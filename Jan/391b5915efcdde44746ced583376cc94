THE Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe (HAZ) has elected seasoned hospitality manager Mr Chiku Mulinde as the new chairperson for the Matabeleland North chapter for 2023. Mr Mulinde, who is general manager for Elephant Hills resort, was elected on Wednesday and takes over from Victoria Falls Safari Lodge general manager Mr Anald Musonza, who has been at the helm for the past three years. HAZ elects a chair from the pool of its members for the particular chapter to lead for a year. Mr Musonza’s chairmanship lasted three years because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Mr Mulinde is not new to HAZ leadership as he once chaired the Beitbridge and Bulawayo chapters where he was general manager for Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn Bulawayo, respectively. He said he was looking forward to work well with all stakeholders for the betterment of the industry and will carry over from where his predecessors left. “I look forward to carrying on with the good work that was being done by my predecessors here in Victoria Falls. This is the tourism capital of Zimbabwe and the work is already cut out for me and my colleagues,” said Mr Mulinde. “The focus will be leading the post-Covid-19 recovery of the destination, implementation of national tourism policies, and work on the sustainable solutions to our work processes, especially the ‘green engage’ initiatives.” <img class="size-large wp-image-436842" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Hospitality-Association-of-Zimbabwe-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Hospitality-Association-of-Zimbabwe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Hospitality-Association-of-Zimbabwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hospitality Association of Zimbabwe HAZ is the trade association representing and promoting the interests of owners and operators of hotels, restaurants, clubs, and related establishments throughout Zimbabwe.
