The Chronicle Canditar Chapanduka, Chronicle Reporter FARMERS have lauded the Government’s decision to create an online platform that gives sound farming advice and tips.
They said the move enables them to acquire critical information to improve their farming techniques. The Government launched a round-the-clock platform on WhatsApp called Agric Tips 365 under the philosophy #Going4Growth #G4G2023 that is anchored on a seamless flow of valuable agriculture-related information to instantly attend, respond to and solve farming-specific inquiries, issues, and emerging concerns. In interviews, farmers said the platform is helping them in improving their yields as it provides them with information on how to grow certain crops, keep animals as well as improving the quality of their outputs. Zimbabwe Farmers’ Union (ZFU) executive director Mr Paul Zakariya said the online platform was the missing link that has ignited hope among farmers. <img class="wp-image-615802 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-65-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-65-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-65-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union chairperson for Matabeleland region, Mr Winston Babbage He said the platform is useful as it is educating farmers. “The platform has managed to bring farmers together and through interacting farmers are also able to engage with each other making it easy to share ideas and ask questions. The online platform has closed the bridge that was created by extension officers since they would not reach out to all farmers,” said Mr Zakariya. “With this online platform, all farmers are brought together to gain the same information at the same time and get their questions attended to.” Mr Zakariya said extension officers have also managed to visit several farms across the country and added farmers to the group. “With the guidance that the farmers are getting from the online platform they have managed to know how to grow each plant properly, and how to keep animals well. This is a positive development because farmers have improved the quality of their animal and crop outputs with a high increase in yields,” he said.  Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers’ Union (ZCFU) Matabeleland North provincial chairperson, Mr Winston Babbage said the platform is benefiting farmers as it has helped them network with each other and acquire knowledge on farming. “Farmers are responding to the online platform as they interact with each other. They get advice and tips, which are critical. Presently, there is an armyworm that we were discussing, which is creating a challenge for us in terms of crop production,” he said. “Farmers get to know of that worm early and get time to take action. We also talk about the chemicals that can destroy the worm.” Mr Babbage said through the online platform most farmers in the region now have access to vital information. -@NomqheleC
