The gathering will showcase programmes already contributing to African food sovereignty and resilience. This includes the African Development Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) platform, which is delivering heat-tolerant wheat, drought-tolerant maize, and high-yield rice seeds to 11 million African farmers in 21 countries.  Giving a brief on the summit Dr Martin Fregene, Director for Agriculture and Agro-Industry at the African Development Bank, said TAAT will produce 100 million metric tonnes of additional food to feed 200 million people. He said: “We know what works in Africa. Taking agricultural technology programmes like TAAT to scale does more than boost agricultural outputs. It increases wealth, creates jobs, and opens our markets up to regional and international trade. It is critical to support these efforts. Africa stands to gain — the world stands to gain — from such a concerted effort.” During the summit, heads of state and government will convene sessions to develop transformational country-specific food and agriculture delivery compacts. Development partners and the private sector will also play significant roles during sessions and the overall summit. <img class="size-large wp-image-675808" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/President-Mnangagwa-leaves-for-Senegal.He-was-seen-off-at-the-Robert-Mugabe-International-Airport-by-Vice-President-Chiwenga-Minister-Muchinguri-and-service-chiefs--680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/President-Mnangagwa-leaves-for-Senegal.He-was-seen-off-at-the-Robert-Mugabe-International-Airport-by-Vice-President-Chiwenga-Minister-Muchinguri-and-service-chiefs-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/President-Mnangagwa-leaves-for-Senegal.He-was-seen-off-at-the-Robert-Mugabe-International-Airport-by-Vice-President-Chiwenga-Minister-Muchinguri-and-service-chiefs--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa bids farewell to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga (right) and Defence and War Veterans Affairs Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri (left) at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport yesterday on departure for Dakar, Senegal to attend the Feed Africa Summit – Picture: Kudakwashe Hunda The inaugural edition was held in 2015, during which the Feed Africa Strategy for Agricultural Transformation (2016-2025) in Africa was proposed. After six years of implementation, the Bank Group has supported more than 250 million people to benefit from improvements in agriculture. This strategy also helped the Bank Group to promptly respond to the impact on Africa’s food security of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by launching a US$1,5 billion African Emergency Food Production Facility to support 20 million farmers to produce 38 million tonnes of food valued at US$12 billion. Within only 45 days after the launch of the facility, the Bank Group had approved US$1,13 billion for operations in 24 countries. The International Fund for Agricultural Development, the Islamic Development Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, and several bilateral partners are among international supporters of the summit.
