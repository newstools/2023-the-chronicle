The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter DYNAMOS Football Club chief executive officer Jonathan Mashingaidze has revealed that they have now put in place four sub committees that will spearhead the club’s 60th anniversary celebrations. DeMbare was founded in 1963 and is one the biggest Zimbabwean clubs based on title wins and fan base.
Also nicknamed Chazunguza, Dynamos has won 22 Zimbabwean league titles and provided the most Soccer Stars of the Year (the highest local accolade for players). Renowned for grooming Zimbabwe’s most loved and popular players like George Shaya, Sunday Chidzambwa and Moses “Bambo” Chunga among others, the blue half of the capital turns half a century and a decade of existence this year.
“Our 60th anniversary celebrations, is an on-going project and an organising committee has now been put in place. We have come up with four sub committees which are legal and human capital, marketing, sponsorship and public relations, budget and finance and research and programmes.  These sub committees will this week put in their 100-day plans and the main organising committee is being led by Denford Mutashu,” said Mashingaidze.
Today, DeMbare can brag about a recognised memory and the prestige that comes with being the only Zimbabwean side to reach the CAF Champions League final. From five league championships, a Madison trophy, two Mbada Diamonds Cups and some Bob Super Cup and Independence trophy titles they have won since 1998, it does not need any chameleonic caution to mention that December 12, 2023 will mark exactly mark exactly 25 years since that fateful second leg of the final in Abidjan, when DeMbare fell 4-2 against ASEC Mimosas. — @FungaiMuderere
