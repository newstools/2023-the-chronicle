The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TODAY marks exactly a year since former Zimbabwe cricket captain Brendan Taylor started serving his three-year ban from the game for failing to timeously report an approach from alleged corruptors. Taylor, who turns 36 this year, made more than 200 appearances for Zimbabwe in international cricket before he was slapped with a ban from all forms of cricket by ICC for corruption breach.
He was also given a separate one-month ban by the ICC for an anti-doping violation, which resulted from a positive test for the stimulant benzoylecognine, a cocaine metabolite. <img class="wp-image-676770 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ujm.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ujm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ujm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Former Zimbabwe cricket captain Brendan Taylor This was after an in-competition test conducted in September 2021 following Zimbabwe’s match against Ireland.
He says he is steadily making progress in his rehabilitation.
“One year of soberness. Taking it one day at a time,” wrote Taylor on his twitter handle. Taylor revealed in January last year that he was facing a ban, after admitting he received a US$15,000 “deposit” for spot-fixing, though he claimed he was blackmailed and never went through with the arrangement.  The ban prevents Taylor, who played in 34 Tests, 205 one-day internationals and 45 T20s before announcing his retirement from international cricket in September 2021, from being involved with cricket until July 28, 2025.
Taylor was a loved player, not without cause he is a hero of Zimbabwe cricket and he served the country well. Among the many cricketers who got their chance after the rebel Zimbabwean players protested against the board in 2004, Taylor was probably the most talented to come through. He played 34 tests, 205 one-day internationals and 45 T20 games for Zimbabwe over a 17-year career from 2004 to 2021.
He is one of Zimbabwe’s best players and is fourth on the list of the country’s top run-scorers in Test cricket and second on Zimbabwe’s ODI list. He amassed 6 677 runs.
