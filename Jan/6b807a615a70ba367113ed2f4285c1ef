The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE late former Mighty Warriors striker Rufaro Machingura was no saint, but her errors do not take away the vast talent she possessed. For former Mighty Warriors coach, Shadreck Mlauzi, the late Machingura is one of the best talents women’s football has ever produced. Machingura was the hero when Zimbabwe lifted their only ever Cosafa Championship title on home soil in 2011. Her five-goal haul in a match against Malawi powered the Mighty Warriors to the semi-finals. Machingura was a key member of the Mighty Warriors side which qualified for the 2016 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations and the Rio Olympic Games. Machingura was announced dead yesterday morning at her home in Waterfalls, Harare succumbing to a lengthy sickness. She was 30. She is survived by a two-month old baby boy. <img class="size-large wp-image-548032" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Denver-Mukamba-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Denver-Mukamba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Denver-Mukamba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Denver Mukamba Her career was not without drama.
In 2014 Machingura made headlines after going airborne with booted feet landing on a referee’s neck. Machingura and her teammate Tariro Makumbe were arrested soon after that match. All the drama along her career compared to the talent she had leaves Mlauzi convinced she was the Denver Mukamba of women’s football. “The women’s football fraternity is deeply saddened honestly because this happens a year after losing Abigail Bhamu who was also a Mighty Warriors player. We are at a loss as the football fraternity. At this difficult time we stand with the family,” said Mlauzi. “She was a utility player, a very versatile one who could easily adapt to any position. She could play as a centre back, goalkeeper, defensive link or striker. She can be likened to a Denver Mukamba looking at her talent and some of her choices outside the field of play. We are concerned by choices our players make off the field at times.  “Here we are talking of so much talent. A utility player, she could play in any position. It’s a big loss to play as a centre back, goalkeeper, defensive link or striker. She had good height as well. It’s a big loss for football,” said Mlauzi. The Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) also sent a condolence message.
“It is with our deepest sorrow that we inform you of the death of former Black Rhinos Queens FC and Mighty Warriors player Rufaro ‘Mafidi’ Machingura. After a long illness. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends, and football community. May her soul find peace,” said FUZ. — @innocentskizoe
