He attended Greenfield Primary School before moving to Henry Low Primary School. For his high school, Fuzwayo went to Milton Boys High School and Christian Brothers College (CBC) where he represented the latter at the Under-16 level. Longtime friend and former teammate at Queens Sports Club, Bonaparte Mujuru said: <img class="alignnone wp-image-665313 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-70-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-70-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-70-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bonaparte Mujuru “He is me, he is a part of me. I have lost a part of me.” Mujuru described the late Fuzwayo as a kind and strong person who still had a lot to give.  “The game was his love, it is a very huge loss to the cricket fraternity and the province due to the passion he had for the game,” said Mujuru. He added that they played for Queens Sports Club throughout their careers and pushed each other to achieve the best. Fuzwayo, a right handed batsman and leg spin bowler managed to play three first class matches for Tuskers in 2017 before an ankle injury brought his career to a premature end. He also coached the Petra High School first team for a couple of years. “I have known Mdu since he was playing Under-16 cricket for CBC about 20 years ago. He was a very good man who wasn’t afraid to speak his mind. He was also very passionate about the game and would have represented Mat ‘land Tuskers for a very long time had it not been for a career ending ankle injury. “He was very supportive and passionate about cricket development that he took up coaching soon after the injury,” said Queens Sports Club manager Stan Rukato. Mourners are gathered at his home in Montrose suburb in Bulawayo and arrangements for his funeral will be announced in due course. — @brandon_malvin
