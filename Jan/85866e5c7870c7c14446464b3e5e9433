The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief ZIMBABWEANS have been urged to take stock of the development programmes which have been implemented by the Second Republic under the leadership of President Mnangagwa as they prove that the Head of State deserves a second term for the country to continue developing. Speaking during a meeting in Gwanda recently, Zanu-PF Matabeleland South provincial chairperson who is also Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism, and Hospitality Industry Nqobizitha Ndlovu said people have to have a clear mind when deciding the fate of the county and not be influenced by the Western countries that want to stall development in the country. “If we do a proper research on the programmes which have been implemented by our President and compare with other leaders we will see that he has done very well. He is doing all these under very hostile conditions of illegal sanctions. The Western countries have seen that it’s impossible to dislodge Zanu-PF and they have now intensified sanctions on some members of the First Family,” he said. “They are now making it more difficult for the Zanu-PF Government but under those difficult conditions we continue to march on. These sanctions have helped to build resilience among young people. Our people now understand that the Western countries have just engaged in a smear campaign in order to discredit Government for their personal gain.” Cde Ndlovu said people have to take time to reflect on the programmes which Government has implemented not only in the province but the entire country. He said this will be possible through deliberate research. Cde Ndlovu said once people know, they will focus their attention on supporting Government instead of aiding the Western agenda of stalling development. He said development projects which have been undertaken by Government were evidence enough that Zimbabweans can build their nation. <img class="size-large wp-image-667482" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/mthuihjhj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/mthuihjhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/mthuihjhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Cde Ndlovu said as the party provincial leadership they will compile a consolidated report detailing various projects that have been implemented by Government under the Second Republic which people can use as a reference point. He said research will enable citizens to remain undeterred when the opposition discredits the President.
“When this report is compiled you will see that we don’t have a single ward where President Mnangagwa’s works haven’t reached in Matabeleland South. When we hear someone say they want to stand and contest President Mnangagwa we wonder what they still want to do when we have a President who is delivering exceedingly well in our province. “For the first time in the history of this country we are now producing enough wheat for the survival of the country. For the first time, under the leadership of President Mnangagwa we have 13 months’ supply of wheat. Youths in the province have received heifers, a number of agricultural development projects have been rolled out. Let’s research to see what our President has done,” he said.  Cde Ndlovu said for the first time there will be a women proportional representation in council this year because Government recognises the importance of women in politics. Government under the Second Republic has rolled out various infrastructural development projects that are transforming Matabeleland region. Examples include construction of Tuli-Manyange Dam in Gwanda, Matabeleland South which will not only bring development to the dry region but will facilitate rural industrialisation. The project is set to transform the dry region of Gwanda.
It is envisaged that once Tuli-Manyange Dam is complete, at least 2 000 hectares will be put under irrigation. In Matabeleland North Government has embarked on a project to construct Gwayi- Shangani Dam. The dam, with a holding capacity of 650 million cubic metres of water, is a significant milestone under the Second Republic in improving the livelihood of rural communities through the creation of an irrigation greenbelt for communities in Matabeleland North. Gwayi- Shangani Dam construction is part of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project (NMZWP) which upon completion is expected to provide a permanent water solution for Bulawayo and Matabeleland Region.
The project started in 1912, but failed to take off under various administrations. <img class="size-large wp-image-674515" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dfx-fbnm-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dfx-fbnm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dfx-fbnm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lake Gwayi-Shangani The revitalised Bubi- Lupane Irrigation Scheme has restored hope for its farmers.
For almost 10 years the irrigation scheme had been lying idle despite its huge potential to improve the locals’ livelihoods.
Today the irrigation scheme has been turned into a green belt. It is one of the flagship Government projects that symbolises hope for nearly 100 families. Government working with various partners has also revived a number of irrigation schemes that have been lying idle in Matabeleland Region. Other projects in the region include construction of the Gwanda Magistrate’s Court, Filabusi Registry Office and modernisation of the Beitbridge Border Post among others.–@DubeMatutu
