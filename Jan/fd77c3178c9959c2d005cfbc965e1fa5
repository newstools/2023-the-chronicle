The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter SOUTH African Amapiano sensation, Musa Keys is expected to stage his debut performance in the resort city of Victoria Falls tonight. The Selema hit-maker who rocked crowds in Bulawayo last year is expected to arrive in Victoria Falls this morning ahead of his show set for the Cotton Club in the evening. Event organiser, Kuda Chigoma, said the show is part of the new upmarket leisure centre’s Cotton Fridays initiative. “Whoever we’ll invite will get a taste of Vic Falls. There’ll be a game drive and tour of the Rainforest in the morning and we’re hoping that if time permits, Musa Keys will go on to experience other activities in Vic Falls before he departs for Harare on Saturday morning where he has another show,” Chigoma said.  He said a mixture of tourism and high-quality entertainment will be the hallmark of Cotton Fridays going forward as they seek to promote tourism as part of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority’s ZimBho initiative. “Hosting a show of this magnitude here gives us an opportunity to spotlight the city by giving a glimpse of it to one of Africa’s rising superstars,” he said. DJs Lexxy, Terrence and Spevah will be Musa Keys’ supporting acts at the show. <img class="wp-image-676365 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Musa-Keys-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Musa-Keys-1-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Musa-Keys-1-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Musa Keys The multi-talented singer, songwriter, DJ and producer who hails from Giyani, Limpopo province has emerged as one of the faces of the Amapiano genre, with hits such as Vula Mlomo and Selema catapulting the energetic prodigy to international fame.
