The Chronicle Business Reporter THE country’s dominant telecoms company, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, has so far delivered 24 gas stoves, 24 fridges, and 60 smartphones to more than 100 winners of its 2023 “Tapinda, Sesingenile” promotion. The popular promotion, with over US$375 000 in prizes to be won, including a brand-new car, eight residential stands, and eight solar systems, among other prizes – transitioned at the turn of the year, from the Ikhisimusi Sifikile/Kisimusi Yatosvika Promotion, which was launched towards the end of 2022. One of the lucky winners, Evelyn Muchingambi, who won a gas stove on week five, could not hide her joy at clinching one of the prizes. <img class="size-large wp-image-660830" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/n-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/n-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/n-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Navdeep Kapur, “Thank you so much, Econet. I have collected my stove and I am so happy,” she said.
To enter the promotion, which is running until February 21, customers simply need to recharge at least US$5 weekly, and thereafter they are automatically in the running to win various prizes.  When a customer spends at least US$10, or the equivalent instore, they stand a chance to win Econet branded items, which include umbrellas, African fabrics (Zambia & Doeks), notebooks, power banks, water bottles, and key holders, among other things. However, customers who spend at least US$60 on airtime alone, stand a chance to walk away with either a residential stand or a solar system. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-457507" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/econet-11-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/econet-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/econet-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Econet chief commercial officer Mr Navdeep Kapur congratulated all 108 winners and promised more exciting prizes to come.
