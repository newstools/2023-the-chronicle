The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MoPSE) has said it is ready to integrate into the country’s education system children of Zimbabweans based in South Africa when they return home at the expiry of special permits they have been using to live in the neighbouring country for the last 15 years. Over 170 000 are based in South Africa under the Zimbabwe Exemption Permit (ZEP) issued by Pretoria in 2017 which will expire at the end of June this year. <img class="alignnone wp-image-626347 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-35-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP) In November 2021, the South African Cabinet indicated that it will not make further extensions for ZEP holders, who were then given a grace period to migrate to other mainstream permits. They have until the end of June this year to get documented after which some will have to return home. As such, Government has been putting in place measures to facilitate the smooth return of the affected Zimbabweans.  Among other things, the returnees will enjoy a free import rebate including the shipping of one vehicle which they will be owning on the date of arrival in Zimbabwe. A number of State actors are also working on several interventions to ensure safe passage for those based in South Africa., The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education spokesperson, Mr Taungana Ndoro said they have a long-term programme to integrate children formerly learning in other countries to fit into the local schooling system. “Our sector has always been absorbing learners from different countries who are in various grades. These learners could be coming from African countries or any other country around the world. Remember, one of our mandates is to provide access to all learners- be it formal or non-formal education,” he said. “As such, we have systems in place in our sector to assess the level of learners from other countries so that we place them in appropriate levels or grades. That has been going on for a long time. So, the affected children from South Africa are most welcome to our sector”. He said recently Zimbabwe and South Africa signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work together on education-related issues. The MOU, he said, covers a number of things ranging from human capital development to teaching and learning aspects. Mr Ndoro said the agreement will remain in place despite the expiry of the ZEP and related permits. “We would like to assure parents, especially those who could be coming back home following the expiry of ZEP that their children are most welcome to the sector and the Ministry will do everything it can to accommodate all the affected learners,” he said. Last week, the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum (ZEF) commended Government for setting plans in motion to assist Zimbabweans to have a seamless return home at the expiry of the Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP). The organisation represents the interests of Zimbabweans in South Africa. Zimbabwe Exiles Forum chairperson, Advocate Gabriel Shumba said the move by the Government was a step in the right direction. <img class="alignnone wp-image-669630 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-94.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-94.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-94-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Advocate Gabriel Shumba The official said the issue of placement in schools for children of returnees coming from South Africa should also be looked into considering the education curricula in the two countries are different. “We have been consistently working with individuals and formations that are affected by the pending repatriation of Zimbabweans from South Africa,” he said. “We are encouraged by the proactive role that the Consulate has taken in engaging Zimbabweans in South Africa, in particular, Mrs Melody Chaurura (the consul-general) and her team. In addition, we also acknowledge the collaboration that the International Organisation Migration (IOM) has had with some organisations to alleviate the challenges on the ground”. — @tupeyo
