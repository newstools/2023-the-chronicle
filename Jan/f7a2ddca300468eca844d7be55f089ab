The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has partnered with its stakeholders to close illegal mining shafts along the railway line as it intensifies the fight against vandalism of its infrastructure. Recently the company’s security officers in collaboration with Jumbo Mine security, witnessed the closure of 15 illegal mining shafts or tunnels dug within the railway reserve land. NRZ says a majority of the illegal mining shafts were passing underneath the railway line and stressed the need to rehabilitate the affected areas as these threaten smooth railway operations. “We encourage the public to help us preserve the railways to avoid loss of life and destruction of infrastructure,” said the company.  The practice has also seen small-scale chrome miners invading Mapanzure area in Zvishavane, Midlands Province where they are conducting illegal mining activities along the Gweru-Zvishavane railway line. NRZ public affairs and stakeholder relations manager, Mr Andrew Kunambura, said such activities pose a huge danger to national infrastructure and disrupt business operations. “The illegal mining is within 45 meters of railway servitude on either side of the railway line, causing land subsidies under the rail,” he said. “Awareness campaigns and arrests of offenders are ongoing throughout the railway reserve land across the country. These campaigns and arrests are being held by the NRZ loss control division in collaboration with the Zimbabwe Republic Police.” <img class="size-large wp-image-669774" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-32-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-32-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-32-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> NRZ team in collaboration with Jumbo mine security team working on closing illegal shafts dug within the railway reserve land. Late last year NRZ, working closely with law enforcement agents arrested 53 suspects in connection with theft and vandalism of railway infrastructure, which has seen the company recovering property worth US$15 959. The company’s loss control and security unit recorded 27 cases of theft and vandalism of property and infrastructure between September and October 2022, which resulted in property worth US$16 925 being lost. The parastatal recovered property worth over US$123 000 while 123 individuals were arrested last year alone.
Following massive vandalism and theft of property, NRZ is capacitating its loss control unit in terms of human resources and acquisition of drones among other hi-tech crime detection equipment. — @SikhulekelaniM1.
