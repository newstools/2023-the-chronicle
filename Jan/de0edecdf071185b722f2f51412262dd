The Chronicle Millicent Dube, Showbiz Reporter As the year closed off last year, Msiz’kay and songstress Bhekiwe were awarded the Song of the year gong at the Roil Bulawayo Arts (BAA) awards for the song Kulula. <img class="alignnone wp-image-671639 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bhekiwe-Dube-a.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bhekiwe-Dube-a.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Bhekiwe-Dube-a-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bhekiwe Dube The song which has been well received by fans undeniably put them in the spotlight and gave them a massive following soon after the RoilBAAs. Interestingly, the song that is off Msiz’kay’s 2022 album Sizalobuhle came as an afterthought. Sharing how the song came up, Bhekiwe who is behind the hit Showstopper said: “The journey to how this song was made is funny. I heard through the grapevine that Msiz’kay was getting ready to drop his album, Sizalobuhle. I’d been following him for some time and I approached him at the last minute, hoping to add another love song. “He agreed and we recorded Kulula a few days before the release of the album.” Little did she know that the song would go on to win the most coveted Song of the year award. Grateful for the experience, Bhekiwe whose star is rising said she is grateful to Msiz’kay for having trusted and featured her on his project.  “I’m grateful and blessed as an up-and-coming artiste to say I have a Song of the Year award. This is truly big and I’m grateful to Msiz’kay for the opportunity. Everything flowed so easily. Kulula was a last-minute recording, but everything happens for a reason and that reason was winning Song of the Year,” said Bhekiwe while adding that she would love to work with Msiz’kay again. Showing how much talent she possesses, Bhekiwe was nominated for the RoilBAA Newcomer of the year award but Andrea The Vocalist won the award. She was also nominated for Outstanding female artist, a category in which Nkwali came out tops. “The other two categories that I was nominated in, I wasn’t lucky enough to win, but they went to well-deserved winners and I couldn’t be any happier. To be mentioned among the likes of Nkwali is massive on its own and Andrea has outdone himself,” Bhekiwe said.
With just three years in the music industry, Bhekiwe released her debut single titled Secret in 2019 and since then, she has shown people that she is more than capable and is ready to be a star. In 2021, she was awarded the social media influencer at the African influencer awards. “The year 2022 was really an awesome year that came with so many opportunities that even I had to pinch myself to see if I wasn’t dreaming. I’m grateful to all the people that showed me support and have been of great assistance to the growth of my brand,” she said while urging people to stay tuned and expect anything from her. “More is yet to come this year. More collaborations are on the way and I’m very excited about this year.”
Turning to her modelling career, Bhekiwe said: “My modeling career is still on the go. It’s just that my musical career has been my priority seeing how I’ve received support and gained a large fan base.”
