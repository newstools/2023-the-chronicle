The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief A 17-YEAR-OLD girl from Gwanda suffering from Down’s syndrome is six months pregnant after she was sexually abused by several people from her area, including her 16-year-old brother. The teenager alleges that she was first raped by an unidentified man who dragged her to a bushy area before sexually abusing her. She has also revealed that a 17-year-old neighbour, her young brother and his friends have also sexually abused her several times. <img class="alignnone wp-image-414011 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/rape.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/rape.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/rape-360x180.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The girl, who stays with her aunt, did not report the abuse. The matter came to light in November last year after her aunt suspected that she was pregnant. The family, however, did not report the matter to the police. Authorities learnt about the matter last week after a ward coordinator from Nkomwa Foundation Trust, a disability organisation, identified the girl. The organisation then launched an investigation into the matter before handing over the case to the police.  Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Loveness Mangena said the matter was under investigation. She said no arrests have been made. The teenager’s aunt who cannot be named for ethical reasons said her niece is not capable of taking care of a child.  “I was distraught when I learnt that my niece was pregnant because she is my responsibility. It means that I will now have to take care of the baby. We didn’t see any point in reporting the matter to the police as we don’t know who impregnated her. My niece isn’t able to engage in a proper conversation as she gets lost along the way,” she said. “All she told us is that there is an elderly man that raped her. She also said her young brother and several of his friends and a 17-year-old neighbour raped her repeatedly. We don’t know who could be the father of the child as it could be any of these people. It seems like the person who raped her the most is her young brother. She does not even understand what all these people were doing to her when they raped her.” Nkomwa Foundation Trust director, Mr Pick Nkomwa said their ward officer alerted them about the teenager’s case at the end of last month and an investigation was launched. He said they assisted the girl to report the matter to the police and further took her to hospital for medical attention where it was established that she was six months pregnant. <img class="alignnone wp-image-623110 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Nkomwa said most of the time such cases get swept under the carpet and victims do not get justice. He said after engaging the teenager they realised that she did not understand what her abusers were doing to her. Mr Nkomwa said a person of her mental state could not consent to sexual intercourse. “People with disability also have sexual rights and they have a right to consent before engaging in sexual intercourse. Given this girl’s condition, she will have to be assisted to ensure the safety of both the mother and the unborn child. It’s sad that people continue to exploit people with disability for their selfish needs “Persons with disabilities are known to be at a higher risk of being subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of gender-based violence. This case is just the tip of the iceberg of what is happening in society to persons with disabilities. We have received a number of cases where people with disability are sexually abused and in most cases, the issues are swept under the carpet,” he said. Mr Nkomwa said in most cases people who are close to the victims such as relatives, neighbours, caregivers and peers are the perpetrators of the assault. <img class="alignnone wp-image-416201 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/assault.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="365" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/assault.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/assault-360x193.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said sometimes people with disability try to report cases of abuse but are not taken seriously. Mr Nkomwa said some fail to narrate the ordeal because of their disability. He said a multi-stakeholder approach was needed in order to protect people with disability. “Relatives should take a leading role in protecting people with disability followed by the community as they live and interact with them on a daily basis. The challenge is that some families are the first to look down on and victimise their disabled relatives. They don’t prioritise protecting their disabled relatives and safeguarding their rights,” he said. Ward 2 councillor, Zwelibanzi Mpofu said there was a need for more awareness in communities on disability issues. She said it is concerning that the teenager’s family learnt about the abuse but did not report the matter to the police. Clr Siziba said parents and guardians should protect children with disability. Late last year, a nine-year-old Tsholotsho gave birth to a baby girl at the United Bulawayo Hospitals after being raped. At the same time, another nine-year-old girl from a farm in Bindura in Mashonaland Central Province was reported to be six months pregnant after being raped allegedly by two 17-year-old brothers from the same farm. — @DubeMatutu.
