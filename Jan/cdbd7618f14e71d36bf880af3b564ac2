AFTER staging a series of live shows in the country over the festive season, South Africa-based Rhumba musician Mxolisi “Mr Bones” Ndlovu is convinced that one can make a living in the country through music. Mr Bones is among the rhumba artistes who were busy over the holiday as he got to stage shows in Tsholotsho, Kezi, Maphisa, and Plumtree. He rounded off his performances at Solusi on New Years day. “From the support that we received, I’m convinced that we can survive in the country using our music. This year, we’ll not wait for December (to stage shows back home) as we’ll be back in April for more shows after receiving bookings, which is a good sign.  “I’m more than convinced that should we relocate, we’ll be able to make a living through music here,” said the musician before his Solusi performance. The Uvukile Umalamben hit-maker said staging shows back home is ideal for most Rhumba artists as their safety is never in doubt, compared to when they perform in South Africa where crime is a major concern. Sharing his plans for the New Year, Mr Bones said he is planning to release an album. <img class="wp-image-577555 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mxolis-Mr-Bones.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mxolis-Mr-Bones.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Mxolis-Mr-Bones-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mxolisi “Mr Bones” Ndlovu (red T-shirt) and Elvis Ndondofly Nzima “I’m thinking of breaking my tradition of skipping a year when releasing an album due to the support my fans showed me with my 2022 production. The album did very well, even the merchandise was bought satisfactorily. Because of that support, I’m thinking of recording because the songs are there.” The artiste said he is also considering shooting visuals for his Singahudulwa Yizinja track off his latest album as it was one of the fan favourites. – @themkhust
