The Chronicle Yeukai Karengezeka, Harare Bureau The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) has started equipping 504 boreholes drilled countrywide under the ongoing Presidential Rural Development Programme by installing solar systems and bush pumps to improve people’s access to clean and potable water. Zinwa spokesperson Mrs Marjorie Munyonga said the exercise was being done after consideration of the prevailing rainfall patterns, which were becoming more erratic as the effects of climate change began to set in . “Because of the current wet spell, drilling of the boreholes has slowed down and focus is now on equipping the drilled boreholes. “The boreholes will be equipped with solar systems while others shall be equipped with bush pumps,” she said. Of the targeted 504 boreholes, 51 of them are in Manicaland, while 53 are in Midlands.  Mashonaland East has 31, Mashonaland Central 79, Mashonaland West 87, and Matabeleland North 57. Matabeleland South has 47 while 105 are in Masvingo. Mrs Munyonga said the targeted 35 000 boreholes under the Presidential Rural Development Programme in the country’s eight rural provinces, would be in place by 2025. “The boreholes will among other functions, provide drinking water for communities, provide the establishment of nutritional gardens, orchards, fishery projects and water for dip tanks. “The Presidential Rural Development Programme is anticipated to help unlock opportunities for rural communities in terms of access to clean and safe water, food security, poverty alleviation and employment creation,” said Mrs Munyonga. In this initiative, Zinwa was working with other Government agencies such as ARDA, Tobacco Research Board, Agritex, the Department of Veterinary Services and the Fisheries Department. Drilling of boreholes in communal areas under the Presidential programme started following the initial handover by the Government, of eight drilling rigs to Zinwa. The eight rigs, procured from India, together with tractors and other assorted drilling equipment, were part of the 50 drilling rigs procured by the Government for the implementation of the presidential rural horticultural programme. <img class="wp-image-667482 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/mthuihjhj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/mthuihjhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/mthuihjhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Government aims to drill at least one borehole in 35 000 villages across all provinces where people will have increased access to clean and potable water.
