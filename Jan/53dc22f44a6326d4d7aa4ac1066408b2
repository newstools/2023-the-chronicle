The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Highlanders Football Club’s Clubhouse is undergoing major renovations that will see the bar transformed into a top-class facility. Revamping the Clubhouse, which was long overdue, started on Tuesday with removal of furniture, liquor stock and delivery of material to be used during renovations. Building material which includes bricks and sand were also delivered to the site. Recent past and present Bosso administrations have for a number of times spoken about the need to spruce up the Highlanders Clubhouse whose lease was secured in 1987 by the late Ndumiso Gumede executive. That Highlanders, who generate extra income outside football from the Clubhouse have seen the need to give the facility, which by their admission is “dilapidated,” a facelift. “We’ve closed the bar for renovation purposes. We project that we will be done by the end of the month. We felt the facility had been dilapidated hence the decision to give it a new look,” said Highlanders spokesperson, Nozibelo Maphosa. The facelift should be a welcome development as it is expected to go beyond the bar area into the toilets that of late had stench coming out.  In a notice put out on Monday, Bosso notified patrons that the facility will reopen in the second week of February. <img class="alignnone wp-image-588956 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bosso-101.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bosso-101.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bosso-101-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso Sprucing up the Clubhouse is meant to turn the facility into an upmarket leisure centre that will be able to compete with other sports clubs in the city and lure patrons as part of generating revenue. Chronicle Sport has it on good authority that the club engaged a local businessman who runs a number of top-class bars within the CBD as well as in the outskirts of the town as their consultant. Hopes are high that after the Clubhouse renovations, Bosso will take their infrastructure development initiative to their Luveve camping house popularly known as Hotel California. Sprucing up the camping house which the club used ahead of their games in the past, will also see it providing accommodation to out of Bulawayo players and even coaches, saving the club substantial amounts. Also outstanding in Highlanders’ structural developments is renovation of their Robert Mugabe Way offices that will be bankrolled by the club’s main sponsors, Sakunda Holdings. <img class="alignnone wp-image-485840 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Sakunda-Holdings.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Sakunda-Holdings.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Sakunda-Holdings-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sakunda Holdings At the 2022 mid-year meeting, Highlanders’ executive reported to members that work at their offices was due to start in September. Sakunda chief executive officer Kuda Tagwirei pledged to revamp Bosso’s dilapidating offices to preserve the legacy of the late Highlanders president Gumede who was at the helm of the club when they acquired the offices, Clubhouse and the camping house in Luveve. — @ZililoR.
