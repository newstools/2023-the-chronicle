The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MIDFIELDERS Devine Mhindirira and Nqobizitha Masuku were absent as Highlanders Football Club held their first pre-season training session yesterday as Balmater Brito’s side began preparations for the upcoming Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season. The side kicked off their pre-season campaign with an in-house conference where players were taught the club’s code of conduct and coaches briefed players on their expectations. The meeting held in the morning was behind closed doors.
In the afternoon, the players took to the field of play and where the Chronicle Sports news crew was allowed to get a glimpse of the proceedings. <img class="wp-image-673479 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/uyytfrt.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/uyytfrt.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/uyytfrt-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso preseason training While Masuku was conspicuous with his absence, the club had an excuse for Mhindirira.
Chronicle Sport has it on good authority that Mhindirira and Bosso are in “progressive” talks after several clubs showed interest in the player, who was part of the 2022 Castle Lager Soccer Stars. The club insists they are not in the know-how of any interest in the player. Well, the midfielder was not part of the squad that trained yesterday but the Bosso allayed all fears.
“Devine has spoken with the coaches and is attending to some personal matters in Harare and will be joining the rest of the squad soon,” Bosso communications officer Nozibelo Maphosa explained.  The duo was not the only absent players from training.
Chronicle Sports has previously reported on Bosso wanting to cut ties with Crispen Ncube, Muziwethu Dlamini, and Toto Banda. The publication understands the trio was called to the club’s offices in early December last year as Bosso sought to find ways to separate from them while they have running contracts. Their absence from training could be an indication the club has found ways to go different directions with the trio. Unlike Mhindirira, Bosso could not account for the absence of Banda, Ncube, Dlamini and Pritchard Mpelele. <img class="size-large wp-image-673473" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dddddgd-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dddddgd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dddddgd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders start pre-season training “We have not communicated anything on exits. We will do so with the advice from the coaches,” said Maphosa.
New faces
Before the start of the training session, a guard of honour was created by the rest of the team for loanee striker Calvin “Kung Fu Panda” Chigonero from Talen Vision, Gillian Nyathi, Mckinnon Mushore sibling to Mason Mushore, both from Bosso90 and Reward Muza who is back from a loan spell at Bulawayo City.  Mckinnon has not been officially announced as promoted to the senior team but from the training session, it appears he will be part of the senior side for the next season. <img class="wp-image-673476 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fikfejfr.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fikfejfr.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/fikfejfr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso preseason training Mason was not part of the training proceedings as he had to consult the team doctor over a knee problem. He was not the only one not to be part of the training session as Prince Ndlovu and Nigel Ncube sat out of the session owing to sickness. <img class="alignnone wp-image-673474 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ljhvhvb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ljhvhvb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/ljhvhvb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
Second assistant coach Joel Luphahla, who was said to be on his way out of Highlanders was in good spirits as he joined the players in the early drills of the training session. It is safe to say he is a happy man and will not be going anywhere. — @innocentskizoe
