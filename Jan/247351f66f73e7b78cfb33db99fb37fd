BAMBANANI irrigation Scheme in Mangwe District which has been lying idle for about 15 years is set to be operational in July after the Government injected US$800 000 towards the project under the Small Holder Irrigation Revitalisation Programme (SIRP). The irrigation scheme is located at Sanzukwi area.
Rehabilitation works, which are at a preliminary stage, are set to be completed by end of June. A tender was awarded to Bulawayo-based Forster Irrigation Company to the tune of US$804 489 to rehabilitate the scheme. Forster Irrigation Company recently completed rehabilitating Makwe Irrigation Scheme in Gwanda, which had been lying idle since 2017.  The 131-hectare Bambanani Irrigation Scheme was established in 2004 and operated for four years before it collapsed.
The Government under the Second Republic is reviving a number of irrigation schemes in the province, most of which have been lying idle, as part of its accelerated rural industrialisation drive.
Some of the irrigation schemes in the province that have been rehabilitated include Makwe, Guyu- Chelesa, Sebasa, Silalatshani, and Tshikwalakwala. A villager from Sanzukwi area, Mr Phumuza Mangena said the revitalisation of Bambanani Irrigation Scheme has ignited their hopes. “It’s been worrying us to see such a vast piece of land which could improve our livelihoods just lying idle. When this irrigation was first established we were relieved,” he said. “We failed to sustain its operations as we couldn’t raise money to buy diesel. Eventually, it died a natural death. Now that something is finally happening we are a hopeful that this will yield fruits.” <img class="size-large wp-image-674430" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bhkmb-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bhkmb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bhkmb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bambanani irrigation scheme in Mangwe Another villager, Ms Nomakhosazana Lunga said they have been operating small gardens in their area.
She said the irrigation scheme will alleviate poverty and help to empower local women and youths. Ms Lunga said they are looking forward to starting to produce at the irrigation scheme.
Mangwe Rural District Council chairperson, Councillor Sindisiwe Nleya said the rehabilitation of Bambanani Irrigation Scheme will boost food security in the semi-arid district characterised by low rainfall patterns. She said the scheme had the capacity to accommodate over 100 households. Cllr Nleya said once complete, the irrigation scheme will go a long in alleviating food challenges. “We are glad that the Government has brought such a huge development to our district. The Second Republic is working tirelessly to ensure that no one and no place is left behind in terms of development,” she said. <img class="size-large wp-image-607417" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-17-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-17-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-17-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Councillor Sindisiwe Nleya Acting provincial irrigation engineer for Matabeleland South, Engineer Shepherd Mpotegwa said scopes of works to be conducted at the irrigation scheme include the installation of an electric motor at the pump station, water pipes, centre pivots, and a drip system. He said they will soon engage the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) to electrify the scheme.
The Government working with various partners is rehabilitating irrigation schemes that have been lying idle in Matabeleland South as part of efforts to improve food and nutrition security. The thrust to improve the diet of the citizenry which conforms to the nutritional mandate follows a rigorous and successful implementation of robust agricultural transformation programmes by the Second Republic which ensured that there is a sufficient supply of food in the country. The country is guided by National Development Strategy 1 which has a thematic area on food security and nutrition.
Under the NDS1, more resources and greater momentum is being injected towards dam construction and efficient irrigation systems. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-575387" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/International-Fund-for-Agricultural-Development-logo-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/International-Fund-for-Agricultural-Development-logo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/International-Fund-for-Agricultural-Development-logo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Second Republic has made food security a top priority and is working towards a US$8,2 billion agriculture industry economy by 2023, underpinned by NDS1 — the driver towards Vision 2030 to make Zimbabwe an upper middle-class economy. SIRP was launched in November 2017 to assist in the revitalisation of irrigation schemes across the country. It is a Government led programme funded by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). Under the Second Republic, Government is prioritising the revival of the agricultural sector through the development of irrigation schemes to alleviate food insecurity and poverty particularly in rural communities.
Matabeleland South falls under ecological regions four and five where dry land cropping is a major challenge due to poor rains. –@DubeMatutu
