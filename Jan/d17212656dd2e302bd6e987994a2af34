The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Sports Editor FORMER Highlanders coach, Mandla “Lulu” Mpofu outsmarted another ex Bosso gaffer Rahman ‘Rush’ Gumbo as Masitaoka defeated Morupule Wanderers 3-1 in a Botswana Premier League match played at Serowe Sports Complex on Saturday. Lethabo Ogotseng, Brian Vuyo Mankanku and Tapiwa Sepatela were on target as Mpofu recovered from a humiliating 4-1 loss at the hands of Jwaneng Galaxy on January 22. Former FC Platinum striker Agrippa Murimba had given Gumbo’s side the lead with an eighth minute thunderbolt but Bafana Ba Magala could not hold on as Masitaoka went on score three without reply and collect the maximum points. <img class="wp-image-594609 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-5-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-5-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Untitled-5-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Philani “Beefy” Ncube The win saw Masitaoka move to sixth on the log with 22 points, 11 away from table topping Gaborone United.
