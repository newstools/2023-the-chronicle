The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter ZIMBABWEAN models Botsi Lyra Noko and Ishmael Murangandi, also known as The Crown Hunter, recently shined at the Miss World Heritage pageant after Noko won the contest while The Crown Hunter was named Mr World Heritage ambassador. The duo had expressed determination to bring accolades home and they did not disappoint. The pageant that was held in India last year saw 13 contestants participating.
Noko, who hails from Hwange, shrugged off competition from Ontlametse Connie Koolatotse from Botswana who was the first runner up and Bhoomika Sawant from India who was the second runner-up. <img class="wp-image-671024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/gfbhm-bd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/gfbhm-bd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/gfbhm-bd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ishmael Mugarandi The Mr World Heritage title went to Sivanathan Thevar from Malaysia while Josue Daniel Sanchez from the Dominican Republic and Anmolpreet Singh from India were first and second runners up respectively.
The male pageant brand ambassador role went to Murangandi while the female post went to Shandrika from Malaysia.
Chronicle Showbiz caught up with Noko who said she was elated that she made her country proud, a move that will uplift her career. “At first I couldn’t believe what had happened. It all happened so fast. I was content with how much I’d achieved as a model by just being on that stage and representing my country. So winning came as a shock, especially for someone coming from a small town like Hwange – the opportunity was priceless,” she said. Noko said she wants to hit the ground running and this will suffice if she is to get support from Zimbabweans.
“As Miss World Heritage, I intend to work on my projects and be the voice of the people. Therefore, I’m appealing to the Government and other organisations that are willing to join forces with me to preserve our heritage sites and promote tourism in our country, to chip in.  “We need to help the local communities, particularly the youth, with entrepreneurial skills as this will help them attain sustainable lifestyles, especially those in rural areas,” said Noko.
She said the experience in India was amazing as she got to learn a lot about the Indian culture and way of living. On the other hand, The Crown Hunter said 2022 was a good turning point for his career.
“The year had a lot of surprises. I had stopped modelling and in my mind, I thought the journey had ended and all that was left was room to mentor young models. However, my career took a sharp turn when I applied virtually to represent Zimbabwe at the Mr World Heritage contest. “I then found myself in India among 20 models from different countries who were vying for the title. At the end of the contest, I was awarded Mr World Heritage brand ambassador 2022-2023 which was a fourth spot up for grabs,” he said.
When he returned home, The Crown Hunter was nominated for the Bulawayo Models Awards in the Outstanding Male Model of the Year category and he clinched the award. <img class="wp-image-671018 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/khvjmgvhn.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/khvjmgvhn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/khvjmgvhn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ismael Muragandi His journey in the modelling industry is continuing as he is now managing a top modelling agency, Fingers Modelling Academy on behalf of Sarah Mpofu who is out of the country. “As part of efforts to help rebuild the modelling industry of Zimbabwe, I’m now managing Fingers Modelling Academy on behalf of Sarah Mpofu. Recently, we hosted a models graduation for our first class since 2019 which saw Tafadzwa Mazai scoop the Face of Fingers Academy,” said The Crown Hunter. – @mthabisi_mthire
