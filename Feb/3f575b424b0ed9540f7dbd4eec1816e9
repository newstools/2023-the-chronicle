Minister Mutsvangwa said the Second Republic has so far licensed 14 language-based community radio stations countrywide to ensure total broadcasting coverage. She said the licensing of more radios stations will help Zimbabweans actively participate from the grassroots level in matters concerning them in line with the devolution agenda. The launch also coincided with the 2023 World Radio Day belated commemorations. “Today’s event is more than the celebration of the World Radio Day as we also officially launch the Beitbridge Shashi Community Radio Station, popularly known as Lotsha FM,” said the minister. “Indeed, community radio platforms have become a key historical mark of His Excellency, President Mnangagwa’s Second Republic. True to his promise of servant leadership and being a listening president, he listened and granted you the community radio station you applied for.”  She said radio is the mass medium of communication which has the greatest and widest audience reach in the world. This year World Radio Day was celebrated under the theme: “Radio and Peace.” <img class="wp-image-531705 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Radio-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Radio-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Radio-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Radio “We take cognisance of the fact that radio can mediate between rival groups or races through dissemination of constructive information that unites rather than divide,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “Radio can encourage dialogue between groups and help find a peaceful way out of misunderstandings and foster development among humankind. “Registered Zimbabwean voters will this year go to the polls in the harmonised elections. As such we expect radio to preach the message of peace to our citizenry.” She said it is critical for people to bear in mind that elections are there for citizens to choose leaders of their choice who will then steer the country forward. The minister said so far President Mnangagwa has been making a clarion call that there should not be any violence before, during and after elections. <img class="wp-image-681572 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-1-copy-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-1-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-1-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa She challenged radio broadcasters to uphold the highest professionalism as they educate and inform the nation on the need to maintain peace and tranquility. “Community radio stations play a pivotal role in creating vibrant community that shares their heritage, culture, innovation and industry,” said the minister. “In a nutshell, these are the ‘go to sources’ for Government projects, policies and vision. They will disseminate economic and social information related to improving livelihoods. As radio broadcasters, I encourage you to preach peace, tolerance and reconciliation, especially among opposing views.” Minister Mutsvangwa said the President has been calling on all political players to come together under Polad to work towards rebuilding the nation in a peaceful manner.

Those with community radio stations that are already on air are increasingly becoming more aware of the resources and programmes they can draw from Government through Devolution.” She said most communities with radios stations were also becoming more involved in Government and development partners’ programmes. “To the people of Beitbridge I want to say, Lotsha FM is for you and whatever comes out on this radio should benefit you,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “This radio station covers a 60km and it will broadcast mainly in Venda and IsiNdebele. As the sole custodians of the station please contribute to the content that comes on the radio.” — @tupeyo
