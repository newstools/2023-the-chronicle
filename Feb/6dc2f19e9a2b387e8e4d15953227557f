I was going to Bulawayo and he was travelling to Hwange. I was driving a Nissan Liberty and so was he. I had seen him before and then during the breakdown we started chatting waiting for help and that’s how we became friends. We then started dating end of 2020. This was followed by the lobola ceremony and official engagement on May 1, 2021,” said Margret. <img class="alignnone wp-image-680347 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-37.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-37.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-37-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lindelinkosi said the couple chose a military-themed wedding, to show the beauty and splendour of the army that he loves dearly. “The Zimbabwe National Army made me the man I am today, a disciplined, hardworking and duty-bound cadre to my nation and the people I serve. It is in my veins. The other reason is to showcase to the world the honour reserved for any man or woman who is serving in any branch of the Zimbabwe National Army. A military wedding is a celebration steeped in tradition, not just for the wedding couple but for the entire wedding party,” said Lindelinkosi. The couple said they did face challenges during wedding preparations, chief among them distance as they had to commute between Bulawayo and Hwange. <img class="alignnone wp-image-680524 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-14-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-14-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-14-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lindelinkosi said his favourite part of the wedding was when Margret was handed over to him and when he kissed his bride. “When her father handed over Margret to me was the favourite part of the wedding. Also, seeing them walking under the ark of arms symbolises the protection of our marriage and cutting of cake using a rifle bayonet. The most touching moment was when we exchanged our vows and when we kissed in front of everyone,” said Lindelinkosi. The couple said the most touching speech was when they promised to love and support each other under the care and guidance of God in front of their parents.  On the menu were beef and chicken kebabs, meatballs, potato wedges, white rice, creamed samp, savoury rice, and macaroni with veggies. There was also, roast beef, stewed beef, roast chicken, butternut, beetroot, potato salad, garden salad, ice cream and fruit salad. For their honeymoon, Margret and Lindelinkosi are planning to travel to Swakopmund, Namibia in April. Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
