The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter VICTORIA Falls residents have resolved to come up with a committee to help in the fight against drug abuse by working with the police and unmasking drug dealers. <img class="alignnone wp-image-591895 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/stop-to-drug-and-substance-abuse.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/stop-to-drug-and-substance-abuse.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/stop-to-drug-and-substance-abuse-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Police launched a war against drugs a fortnight ago code-named “No to dangerous drugs and illicit substance: See something, Say something.” The operation is a multi-agency effort and is aimed at flushing out criminal drug syndicates behind the current drug epidemic. Some of the drugs finding their way to the public include mbanje, cocaine, crystal meth, banned addictive cough syrups such as BronClear, Benylin with Codeine and Adsco-Salterpyn syrup among others. <img class="wp-image-480278 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/mbanje.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/mbanje.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/mbanje-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mbanje There are also concerns that liqours like Zed and Tetankau are being smuggled from Zambia through the Victoria Falls border and an illegal smuggling point in Chisuma. To start a localised campaign to address the prevailing challenge of abuse of alcohol, drugs and substances in the city and surrounding areas, Hwange West legislator Mr Godfrey Dube on Saturday convened a stakeholders meeting at Brethren in Christ Church hall in Victoria Falls.  Scores of concerned residents attended the meeting including various stakeholders such as police, youth and women representatives, church leaders, sportspersons, arts sector representatives, residents’ leaders and council. Participants expressed concern on how the family system had collapsed. Concern was raised about absence of sports and recreational facilities as well as job opportunities to keep youths away from drugs. Parents were also implored to ensure that their children have enough food when going to school or events to avoid exposure to drug laced foodstuffs from colleagues. The meeting resolved that there should be a positon paper for Hwange West and the city on drugs. They also resolved to form an adhoc committee to deal with the issue of drugs, identify drug dealers and assist law enforcement agents with resources to increase patrols. Industry was urged to avail jobs for youths so that they are not idle. Residents also called for amendment of national laws so that they are punitive on drug peddlers. — @ncubeleon.
