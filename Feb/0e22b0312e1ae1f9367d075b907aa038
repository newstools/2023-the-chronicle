The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter LIVEWIRE Zimbabwean winger Daniel Msendami played 70 minutes as his Jwaneng Galaxy FC began the second half of the Botswana Premiership season on a bright note, toppling champions Gaborone United with a 1-0 win against Morupule Wanderers. Msendami, who is having a dream season with Jwaneng Galaxy was replaced by Boikobo Osupile three minutes before the championship contenders got the solitary strike from Thabang Sesinyi. The victory against the Rahman Gumbo-coached Morupule Wanderers took Jwaneng Galaxy’s points tally to 40 points, two ahead of Gaborone United who were held to a 2-2 draw by Security Systems.
Msendami, who has scored five goals in the 13 matches he has played, providing six assists in the process was happy with the victory. A product of the vibrant Highlanders juniors’ policy, Msendami is one of the in-form players in the Botswana Premiership, with reports that teams in South Africa, Tanzania and Qatar being interested in his services. “We’re taking each game as it comes and completing a double over Morupule Wanderers is good but now we’ve to focus on our next game. Even though I didn’t score or assist at the weekend, I’m happy with the contribution I made to the team and will keep working hard,” Msendami said. While Msendami enjoyed game time, his Zimbabwean compatriot Nqobizitha Masuku warmed the bench for Jwaneng Galaxy. <img class="wp-image-678744 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/werj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/werj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/werj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nqobizitha Masuku Coached by South African Morena Ramoreboli, Jwaneng Galaxy are yet to lose a match this season with 12 wins and four draws from the 16 matches played this season. When the 2019/2020 Botswana Premier League season was halted due to Covid-19, Jwaneng Galaxy were crowned champions as they were on top of the log with 10 matches to go when the action was brought to an abrupt end by the global pandemic. For Gumbo, he was left baffled as his team suffered a fourth consecutive defeat, stretching their winless run to six games. Morupule Wanderers are 12th with 15 points, just four points above the drop zone.
Gumbo should be hard-pressed to turn around the fortunes of the club.  – @ZililoR.
