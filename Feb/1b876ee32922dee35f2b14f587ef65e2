THE West Indies senior men’s cricket team is leaving Zimbabwe today for South Africa where they will play all the three formats of the game against the Proteas starting on February 28. After winning the two-match Test series against Zimbabwe 1-0, the Windies are in for a tough assignment against South Africa. The Caribbean side made two changes to the team that played in Zimbabwe with Alick Athanaze and Akeem Jordan replacing left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican and batter Nkrumah Bonner.  After the series win, Kraigg Brathwaite, the Windies Test skipper said it was good to get the series win in Zimbabwe as they want to make winning a habit and acknowledged that it will be a different ball game when they play against a much stronger South African side and is confident, they will do well despite his fast bowlers not having had much time in Zimbabwe. “It is a good feeling, winning any game is always a habit so winning is a habit so it was good to come and get the series win and we know we have a tougher South Africa team. We have a three-day game in South Africa before the first Test so I am happy the bowlers are fresh and I am quite confident the guys will be ready against a better batting attack to be fair. I am very happy with the guys in this tour (Zimbabwe) but I think the guys are ready to go but we know it’s going to be a challenge,” said Brathwaite. <img class="wp-image-657638 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/xzdszf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/xzdszf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/xzdszf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Proteas players This was West Indies’ first visit to Zimbabwe for Test cricket since 2017 where they also played the same number of matches and winning with a similar score line as well. — @brandon_malvin
