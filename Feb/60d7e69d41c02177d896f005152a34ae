The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) president Tendai Tagara says school athletics is the backbone of athletics in the country and is pleased to see the return of the sport in both primary and secondary schools. <img class="alignnone wp-image-548430 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Naaz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Naaz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Naaz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tagara is in Bulawayo where he is assisting Eswatini World Athletics coach Muzi Mabuza in conducting an eight-day level two Coaches’ Education and Certification System at White City Stadium. The course got underway on Friday last week at White City Stadium. The same venue has seen both primary and secondary schools hold inter-house and district competitions in the last few weeks. <img class="wp-image-490251 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/WHITE-CITY-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-5-000-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/WHITE-CITY-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-5-000-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/WHITE-CITY-STADIUM.-INCOME-IN-2019-5-000-HIRE-CHARGE-6-977-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> White City Stadium This has allowed Tagara to assess some of the action from the schools and he is impressed with what he has seen so far. “I am happy with the performance of the kids that l have seen here over the last week. One thing l have noted is if you look at the Under-18 it’s a generation that lost the Under-15 and 17 age group they almost lost again the Under-18 age group. “The three years lost can be seen from the performances and the times they are recording. One can tell they can do better with more training because their endurance levels are very low,” said Tagara.  “However, I am happy that our school kids are on the track because this is where we get all our talent from. Athletics in schools is the backbone of athletics in the country and we are more than pleased to have it back. The fact that athletics is back in schools means we can have more athletes’ representation at international competitions. One thing we have to push is to have teachers trained as athletics coaches and technical officials. This will go a long way in making sure that our kids learn the correct basics from a young age,” said Tagara. <img class="wp-image-683461 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tendai Tagara He also called on athletes to register for the Naaz Inter-club Track and Field championships to be held at White City Stadium next month.
