The Chronicle Rutendo Nyeve, Business Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has tightened its security systems across the country, which has seen the company being able to detect 58 percent of reported cases and recover over 50 percent of the stolen property. <img class="wp-image-510576 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/NRZ.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/NRZ.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/NRZ-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> NRZ Working closely with the police, about 28 culprits that were involved in vandalism and theft of railway infrastructure elements are now receiving sentences ranging from four months to 10 years. This emerged during a pass-out graduation parade for 62 newly recruited NRZ loss control and security officers that was held at West Gate in Bulawayo on Saturday. Director for strategic policy planning and monitoring and evaluation in the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Mr Allowance Sango, who represented Minister Felix Mhona as the guest of honour, commended NRZ for taking steps to protect its critical infrastructure and urged the graduating officers to maintain discipline as well as shun corruption. <img class="wp-image-627799 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-36-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Allowance Sango “As fresh graduates, I implore you to understand and appreciate the character of security establishment. You need to have the discipline to survive in security. Embrace discipline to protect railway property, customer cargo and our people,” he said. “I am confident that with the richness of training you have just undergone, you are now complete in terms of discipline. I urge you to have zero tolerance to indiscipline, corruption, theft and vandalism of railway properties.” The new officers compromised NRZ employees who were promoted from other sections within the company, National Youth Service graduates, and members of the general public who applied from all the country’s 10 provinces. Among the graduands were 23 females, a development that charmed the ministry.  “I would like to commend the general manager and her staff for keeping the national gender thrust alive. Please keep it up. More still needs to be done in terms of gender balance but this is indeed a step in the right direction,” said Mr Sango. Speaking at the same occasion NRZ general manager, Ms Respina Zinyanduko, said a fully-fledged loss control department is expected to significantly reduce cases of vandalism and other criminal cases that can potentially lead to the reversal of gains by the company. <img class="wp-image-677803 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/unnamed.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/unnamed.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/unnamed-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> NRZ General Manager Ms Respina Zinyanduko “The fight against vandalism is a never-ending war but we are determined to bring the vice under control. During the course of the year 2022, we experienced widespread cases of vandalism of the rail track and illegal mining activities, which destabilise our tracks, especially in provinces like Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland West, and the Midlands,” she said. “A number of arrests were made but these miners continue to cause us problems. As NRZ, we always take pride in our loss control department as it is key to our business endeavour to turn around the fortunes of the organisation. “The loss control department protects our assets, personnel, and customer goods.” During the colourful event, the new officers conducted drills and marches to showcase high levels of discipline and determination to serve the company by reciting a security pledge. Among the best recruits were two females who were part of the three-award winners. Tinaye Duri was awarded the overall best with Beauty Manene coming second while Emmanuel Joseph was the third best and most disciplined. NRZ said the graduands went through rigorous physical exercises that included, road runs and drill movements. They also went through class lessons encompassing first aid, Criminal Law Codification, and Reform Act, railway systems module, and weapon  handling. The function was attended by NRZ board members who included Retired Colonel Tshinga Dube, Ms Dorothy Mavolwane, service chiefs, NRZ management among others. — @nyeve14
