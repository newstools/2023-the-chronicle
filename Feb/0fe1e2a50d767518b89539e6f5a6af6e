The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Reporter ZANU PF provincial structures are set to convene Provincial Coordinating Committee  (PCC) meetings this weekend in readiness for the nationwide cell building and verification exercise scheduled to begin early next week.
The revolutionary party is on a nationwide drive to mobilize five million votes ahead of the forthcoming harmonized elections this year.
In a notice of its official Twitter handle, the Commissariat department said: “The National Political Commissar Cde Dr Mike Bimha is requesting all provinces to convene PCC meetings either this weekend. “Agenda will be discussions on preparations for a nationwide cell building and verification exercise scheduled to begin early next week.”
According to the notice, provinces are required to indicate to the commissariat department, which date between Saturday and Sunday they are going to hold the PCC meeting.
