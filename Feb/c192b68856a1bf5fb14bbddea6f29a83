Hosts Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will play each other twice in the course of this week as one of them will earn the ticket to Rwanda. The Zimbabwean women were victims of yet another heavy defeat yesterday evening, this time at the hands of Mozambique who won 95-43. Zimbabwe had on Wednesday lost 105-41 against Angola. From the three games they have played so far Zimbabwe have only managed one win, a 69-57 triumph over Zambia. Against Mozambique, Happiness Maroto was Zimbabwe’s top scorer with 15 points and one assist. The trio of Fransica Sekete, Thelma Goredema, and Tadiwa Mabika had the second best score with six points each. “We played better against Mozambique than against the Angolans. I have told the girls that we must get better in every match. We have seven games in eight days and every game we must learn and continue learning. “Eight of the 12 players in the squad are rookies and this is an opportunity for them to learn. My message to them daily is to get better with each game. We play the same team again tommorow and we will see how the girls play it should tell us if we are improving,” said Chitauro. — @innocentskizoe
