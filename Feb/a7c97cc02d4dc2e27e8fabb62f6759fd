The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN junior squash players are set to take part in two different international events between June and July this year. The top three players from the Zimbabwe Juniors Squash Championships which were recently held in Bulawayo will be the country’s representatives in the South Africa’s interprovincial schools tournament and the World Junior Championships. The South African tournament is scheduled for June 24 to 28 while the World Junior tournament is set for July 18 to 23 in Australia. However, players will be sent to participate at the tournaments depending on the availability of funds as the Squash Rackets Association of Zimbabwe (SRAZ) is looking for sponsorship and the final teams will be announced once funding for the trips has been finalised. “The teams will be announced once we source the funding. There is also a likelihood that some players in the top three may not make it to the championships for various reasons, so the announcement is usually a month before the tournament,” SRAZ chairperson Lucky Mlilo said.  At the recently held Zimbabwe Junior Championships, the Under-19 boys and Under-16 girls’ winners was a family affair as Ryan Gwidzima and Natasha Gwidzima emerged triumphant over their opponents. Ryan beat Talent Jambo 3-0 and Natasha also registered a similar score over Bella Mellor. In the girls’ Under-19 section, the top three was made up of Delight Nyakabawo, Tumi Sibanda and Ngaakudzwe Mukuhwa respectively while in the boys’ side, Gwidzima was followed by Jambo and Rukudzo Midzi.
Gwidzima (Natasha) topped the standings in the Under-16 girls followed by Mellor and Alicia. Jessica Levendale, Gail Zirebwa and Owami Sithole made the girls Under-14 top three while the boys’ list was made up of Isaac Rowlands, Barno Robb and James Widdop.
Taking part in the upcoming events will give the Zimbabwean youngsters the much-needed experience and exposure to the highest level of the game. — @brandon_malvin
