The diplomat will hold meetings with Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Frederick Shava among other Ministers. Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry spokesperson Mr Livit Mugejo confirmed the development in a statement yesterday. <img class="wp-image-626344 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-34-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Livit Mugejo “During the visit, Ambassador Robert Scott is scheduled to meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Hon Ambassador F.M. Shava together with relevant Government Ministers. The meeting is expected to review the recent US-Africa Leaders Summit which was held in Washington DC, and to which, Zimbabwe was represented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Hon Ambassador Shava,” said Mr Mugejo. Zimbabwe attended the US-Africa Leaders Summit in December last year whose aim was to find areas of cooperation between America and African states. Dr Shava represented President Mnangagwa.
Mr Mugejo said Ambassador Scott’s visit is aimed at finding new areas of cooperation and strengthening the existing ones.  “On the back of the inroads which the two countries have made in cooperating, at both bilateral and multilateral levels, Zimbabwe is expected to apprise Ambassador Scott on the African Development Bank (AfDB) Structured Dialogue Programme and the associated reform priorities which the Government has implemented, especially in the last five years,” said Mr Mugejo. Last week, the country held a high level AfDB Structured Dialogue Programme with some of its creditors in a clear commitment of Zimbabwe’s intentions to clear its debts. The meeting was attended by officials from the AfDB led by its president Dr Akinwumi Adesina, former Mozambican President Joachim Chissano, the high level facilitator of the engagements and Cabinet ministers. <img class="wp-image-627766 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> African Development Bank Issues around compensation of white former commercial farmers, debt clearance plans and the deleterious illegal economic sanctions were discussed in the meeting. Last week, the President said Zimbabwe’s engagement and re-engagement efforts continue to bear fruit as evidenced by the partial removal of illegal sanctions by the European Union, development assistance by the European Development Fund, and the invitation of Harare for the first time to the United States-Africa summit last year among others. President Mnangagwa said this at State House in Harare while hosting a reception for ambassadors and international organisations accredited to Zimbabwe for his annual New Year greetings and meeting with diplomats. <img class="wp-image-684737 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/unnamed-13.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/unnamed-13.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/unnamed-13-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> AfDB president, Dr Akinwumi Adesina “I applaud you all for the progressive and cordial nature of the ongoing engagement efforts. This is reflected by the numerous successes we continue to score together, arising from our collaboration and co-operation. “Furthermore, my Government acknowledges the removal of sanctions by the European Union and development assistance availed by the European Development Fund. It is pleasing that political dialogue with the EU continues under Article 8 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement,” said President Mnangagwa. “We are optimistic that the remaining punitive and inhibitive illegal sanctions on the Zimbabwe Defence Industries will be removed. It is in our collective interests to continue taking advantage of opportunities and mutually beneficial partnerships which our countries have to offer in terms of investment and trade.” – @nqotshili.
