The Chronicle Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter WELSHMAN Sibanda famously known as “Welsh the Stylist” does not believe in standing still. He is always working and soon some of his works will be on display. He told Saturday Chronicle that his new fashion collection is going to blow people away and leave a mark to show the world that he was truly born for this. <img class="alignnone wp-image-684383 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hfhjm.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hfhjm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hfhjm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I am a vintage fanatic and so the collection is going to be infused with print life. This is because times have changed so I want to introduce a bit of high fashion, beading and lace life (avant-garde). I have been a fashion model and stylist since 2013 and then in 2020, I infused it with designing and tailoring. I showcase everywhere where I am invited to boost my brand,” said Welsh the Stylist.  He used the term “avant-garde” to explain his new collection which comprises new and experimental ideas and methods in his art and style. The fashion designer and style icon said in the process of showcasing his work, he wants to also support up-and-coming talent and motivate anyone that “it is possible”. Welsh the Stylist stands as the reigning Matabeleland fashion week’s style icon and not only is he a designer but is an actor, model and musician. “On acting, I was part of Amanxeba/Scars by John Mabuyane and The Signal by Daniel Laskar films which are both award-winning at Bulawayo Arts Awards. Some productions are not yet out so it is difficult to comment on them for now. I have done modelling with Edgars and I also do music videos for local artistes like Soft,” said Welsh the Stylist. <img class="alignnone wp-image-684381 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hnbvvgg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hnbvvgg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hnbvvgg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He added that on music, he will be dropping a single this year as local radio stations are still jamming to his old songs such as Ngiyakukhumbula, Move Your Body and Jonana. He draws his inspiration as a fashion star from the leading South African designer and icon David Tlale. “I am a businessman in the fashion industry. It is high time we commercialise our craft to sustain ourselves and also to create employment for the masses. People want change because the times have also changed. “I do everything on my own from drafting, cutting and tailoring. I sometimes outsource tailoring services if I am under pressure but some brands help me here and there. It is high time creatives unite for the betterment of the fashion industry. The Government should also help the up-and-coming talent. Funding must be availed to everyone who is actually working hard. United we stand but divided we fall,” said the multi-talented artist. <img class="alignnone wp-image-684380 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/mkkkmbnh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/mkkkmbnh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/mkkkmbnh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Welsh the Stylist has styled the likes of Ricco Andrews, Arthur Ace Evans, Sanah Designs, DJ Liz, Annie G and Skaiva. He said he has future plans to expand his horizon, groom more young stars and continue learning as the creative sector is dynamic. Welsh the Stylist said he is grateful to his family, friends and followers for their love and continued support. — @ReeSibanda
