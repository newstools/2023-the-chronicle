The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter WORLD Athletics (WA) certified coach and instructor Muzi Mabuza has hailed the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) for making efforts to improve the standards of athletics in the country by equipping coaches at the junior level. Mabuza, who hails from Eswatini, is conducting an eight-day level two Coaches’ Education and Certification System at White City Stadium. The elite course got underway on Friday last week, with its focus being on sprints and hurdles only. It has 10 participants with seven of them being local coaches, two from Zambia and one from Botswana. “It’s a course we feel is critical because it focuses on getting those kids that are Under-18 to transcend into senior level. “For that transition to be achieved we need to upgrade the quality of our coaches.  “Our talented athletes need to get the correct technical knowledge for them to move from junior to senior level. “For a country to have success at the international level the coaches need to be quality. “I must acknowledge the culture of athletics in Zimbabwe. Always when you go to junior competitions you see Zimbabwe has representation and the talent is there. We realise most of them then turn the young talent into world beaters,” said Mabuza. Some of the international competitions that Naaz will be hoping to have representation include the African Junior Champions in Lusaka from April 29 to May 3, the Africa Youth Olympics in Congo Brazzaville in June and the All Africa Games Ghana in July. – @innocentskizoe.
