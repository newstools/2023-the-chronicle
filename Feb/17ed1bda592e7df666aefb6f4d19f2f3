KWEKWE-based ferrochrome producer Zimasco says its ongoing expansion programme, which will see two more state-of-the-art furnaces being constructed, will boost output and go a long way in reducing carbon emissions as the fight against climate change across the globe escalates. The company resumed operations last month following a standoff with power utility Zesa over power tariffs.
Out of the existing six furnaces, the company is utilising four, furnaces numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6, which are operating at full capacity. Furnace 1, which underwent upgrading has also been switched on and is in test mode whilst furnace 2, which is also being upgraded, is expected to be up and running by May.  Most of these furnaces are old with the latest having been commissioned in 1981. Those operating are producing about 144 000 tonnes per annum with output expected to double after completion of the upgrade exercise of the remaining two furnaces, as well as the construction of two new modern units. The company expects the agglomeration and sinter plant to inject an additional 25 000 tonnes of chromite from the chrome fines it will be processing. The acquisition of modern equipment is seen as a game-changer for the factory as it will go a long way in reducing carbon emissions in light of the recent effects of climate change. During a recent tour of the plant by journalists, Zimasco chief operations officer, Mr Namatai Mapfumo, was upbeat about how the state-of-the-art equipment will reduce emissions. <img class="alignnone wp-image-486822 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Zimasco-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Zimasco-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Zimasco--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We have upgraded furnace 1 and we are in the process of upgrading furnace 2 replacing the old material with state-of-the-art equipment. “These are semi-closed submerged arc furnaces, which consume less power and produce less emissions due to the equipment installed there,” he explained. Mr Mapfumo said the new plants will be even more advanced as they do not emit any smoke at all as it is captured, recycled, and used in the agglomeration and sinter plant.
“The new furnaces 7 and 8 will be fully closed, which means they don’t emit any carbon. The off-gasses that will be produced by the two furnaces, will be captured, cleaned and used to fire the agglomeration and sinter plant,” he said. “In other words, we are recycling the off gasses instead of releasing them into the air.” Mr Mapfumo, however, said the smoke being produced by the old furnaces was not harmful to humans as they were constantly tested by regulators. <img class="wp-image-639119 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-226.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-226.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-226-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ferrochrome industries and boilers He said in the long term, plans are underway to refurbish the old furnaces, replacing them with state-of-the-art equipment just like what happened to the first two furnaces. The agglomeration and sinter plant is expected to utilise about 25 percent of chromite fines, which are lying idle at the company due to limited processing methods. If successful, this will be a successful environment story that might need other companies to emulate and replace old outdated machinery with latest environment-friendly equipment, said the company. After completion of the expansion projects, which are expected to be finished by the end of the year, hopes are that 400 new jobs would have been created. At the moment the company has 550 direct workers and 700 indirectly.
