The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SUPPORTERS of Hwange Football Club will get a feel of how their team will line up in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League when they square off against Ngezi Platinum Stars at the Colliery Stadium this afternoon in a friendly match. Ngezi Platinum are having their pre-season camp in Victoria Falls and will take advantage of the proximity to Hwange to test their strength. The Platinum miners finished fourth last season under Takesure Chiragwi who had taken over from Benjani Mwaruwaru. <img class="wp-image-661580 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-13-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-13-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-13-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> File photo: Takesure Chiragwi addressing media Under Chiragwi, Madamburo fought off the challenge of a resurgent Highlanders for the fourth position, with Bosso eventually finishing fifth. Mwaruwaru was sacked during the course of the season after a string of poor results together with his assistant Bongani Mafu, now the man in charge of Hwange. Chiragwi managed to impress the Madamburo bosses who then appointed him substantive coach. He has been handed the task to lead the side to their first league title, something that has eluded them since they made their entry into the PSL in 2016. Ngezi Platinum have added some numbers to their squad ahead of the new season. Former Chicken Inn midfielder Malvin Gaki has joined the Mhondoro based side on a two-year contract. He made the switch on a free transfer after his deal with the Gamecocks expired in December.  Ngezi Platinum have also sealed a deal with Gareth Madhake, previously with Black Rhinos. Madhake had reports linking him to Dynamos during this transfer window. The 2023 league season is set to get underway later this month with a clash between Chibuku Super Cup Champions winners Bulawayo Chiefs and league champions FC Platinum. – @innocentskizoe
