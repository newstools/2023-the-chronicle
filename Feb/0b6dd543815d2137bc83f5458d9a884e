The Chronicle Lovemore Dube, Sports Correspondent FORMER Black Rhinos and Highlanders midfielder Sifiso Mguni’s body finally left Johannesburg, South Africa, for burial in Bulawayo this morning. He was 49.
Mguni died in Cosmo City in Johannesburg on January 23 this year and his body been lying at a Johannesburg mortuary as his family sorted out the paperwork with the South African and Zimbabwe Governments. The all clear was received on Wednesday leading to the family finalising that the body leaves on Thursday morning. His eldest sister Promise Keti said the body left Johannesburg in the morning and was expected in Bulawayo overnight for burial this morning.
“They have left Johannesburg. There shall be a church service at Kings and Queens Funeral Parlour tomorrow morning followed by burial at Umvutshwa Cemetery,” said Keti.  Mguni started his career at New Magwegwe streets before playing for the Mhali Primary School team as a goalkeeper. He proceeded to Gifford High School where his love for the game had his father Phineas worried that he was neglecting his books.
He was transferred to Inyathi High School for his final year at secondary education where he managed to please the family with good results.
Initially his father got him a job but after finding his feet, the former Young Blood junior decided to quit Radiator and Tinning in favour of a professional career at Highlanders. He was part of the Bosso side that won the 1993 inaugural Premier Soccer League and had a trial with SuperSport in South Africa.
The move did not materialise as Bosso insisted that negotiations must be done while Mguni and Itai Masawi were in Zimbabwe.
A year later Mguni moved to Shu – Shine before joining Black Rhinos where he made his mark as a stand out midfielder good enough to earn caps at senior level for his country and an appearance on the Soccer Star of the Year calendar. <img class="wp-image-636355 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-10-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-10-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-10-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mguni has been described by the legendary Stix Mtizwa as having been a delight to watch on the field.

Mguni has been described by the legendary Stix Mtizwa as having been a delight to watch on the field.
“He was such a wonderful and very skillful player, a joy to watch in midfield. When we were in Division One, he played a pivotal role in helping the team gain promotion into the Premier Soccer League in 1997. We have lost a gallant son of football, my condolences to his family and Black Rhinos. I say go well, we will always and forever remember you,” said Mtizwa who coached Mguni at Rhinos.
Mguni is survived by his son Mlungisi, a budding rugby star, his mother, and three sisters Promise, Zanele (Banda) and Pretty (Nyathi). — @lovdube
