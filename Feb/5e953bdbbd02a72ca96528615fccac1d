The Chronicle Online Reporter The High Court of Zimbabwe in Harhas stopped a possible takeover of earth moving equipment business, Adlecraft Investments by Mr Gillad Shabtai and Mr Munyaradzi Gonyora from an Israeli investor, Mr Ofer Sivan. Two years ago, Mr Shabtai and Mr Gonyora attempted to place Adlecraft Investments under voluntary corporate rescue claiming that the company was on the verge of financial distress. The court heard that Mr Shabtai and Mr Gonyora, previous non-executive directors of Adlecraft Investments, passed an irregular board resolution in October 2021 to place the company under administration. However, on 29 November 2021, Mr Sivan sought temporary relief from the High Court for the illegal board resolution. High Court Judges Justice Jacob Manzunzu and Justice Siyabona Paul Musithu granted the relief on 15 September last year. On 22 February 2023, Justice Manzunzu handed over a judgment in favour of Mr Sivan ordering that the resolution which was passed by Mr Shabtai and Mr Gonyora was illegal. “The provisional order granted by this court on 29 November 2021 be and is hereby confirmed. The resolution dated 1st October 2021 attached to the application marked “E” endorsed under CRP3/21 is declared null and void and is hereby set aside.” Justice Manzunzu further ruled that the appointment of Alexious Dera as corporate rescue practitioner of Adlecraft was set aside. “There shall be absolution from the instance in respect of the relief sought to interdict and restrain the first respondent from representing himself out to the public or transacting on the perjured capacity of a holder of equity in Adlecraft Investments (Private) Limited. “The first and second respondents (Shabtai and Gonyora) are ordered to pay the applicant’s costs on the ordinary scale,” Justice Manzunzu added.
