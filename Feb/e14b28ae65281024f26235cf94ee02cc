The Chronicle Anna was a New Testament Prophetess, she is mentioned in the gospel of Luke, and she was an elderly Jewish woman who prophesied about Jesus Christ at the temple of Jerusalem.  Luke 2:36 – 38
And there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of great age, had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity; and this woman was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fasting and prayers night and day. And coming in that instant she gave thanks to God and spoke of him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

Many people look down on Prophetesses who are called by God to prophesy just like their male counterparts the Prophets, because of lack of proper Biblical knowledge and balanced in depth revelational teachings about this subject. Hence, this serves the real purpose of this book to enlighten the Body of Christ about these things. Prophecy is still valid and useful for the church today, and is a clear implication of 1 Corinthians 13 v 8-12 and Acts 2v 17-18. Prophecy is a Spirit prompted, Spirit sustained utterance that is rooted in a true revelation. Prophets spoke in times past as they were moved by the Holy Spirit just as they still speak today. 2 Peter 1:21 21
For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. NIV Prophecy and the prophetic ministry is God’s will in the New Testament, contrary to the teachings by certain people that it ended in the Old Testament. Jesus highly regarded the Prophets and even Prophets today are in an intimate place very close to His heart. You may be close to God, be prophetic and not be a prophet but it is virtually impossible to be a Prophet and not live in an intimate place close to God. To be continued…
