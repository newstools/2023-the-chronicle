WHILE many people were hiding in the safety of their homes last Friday as the rains were ravaging Bulawayo streets, some Pumula Old residents were busy trying to secure their property from being damaged by rains as their homes had collapsed. The rains, which were characterised by lightning and thunder, persisted for the whole night in most suburbs leaving some houses flooded and property destroyed. <img class="alignnone wp-image-682698 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cvdfeas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cvdfeas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cvdfeas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Unlike the homes that were just flooded, Pumula Old residents lost their homes as the walls crumbled on top of them at night. The affected families now have no homes to live in. The suburb is one of the oldest in town and still has some of its structures built using mud bricks, which were plastered with cement. The use of mud itself exposes the houses to the elements such as heavy rains and strong winds. Some of those affected have resorted to staying inside abandoned cars while others said they had no option but to continue living in what was left of the destroyed homes.  A Chronicle news crew yesterday spoke to one of the five affected residents, Mr Revolution Ndlovu, who said he was sleeping when he felt their house collapse due to heavy rains. He said he was confused for a moment wondering what was happening but reality only kicked in when he saw the rain pouring in his room. <img class="wp-image-682702 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/vty7u.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/vty7u.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/vty7u-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rains destroy houses in Pumula old gogo Elizabeth Ndebele “I couldn’t believe it when I saw the rain pouring in my bedroom. I immediately woke my brother up and told him we had to move the little property we have. Fortunately, no one was hurt,” said Mr Ndlovu. He said they have resorted to sleeping at an old abandoned bus that is near their home as they fear for their lives and do not trust the structure that was left. “We should have campsites as communities that will be on standby for incidents like this one because right now I have nowhere to go. I cannot expect my neighbours to accommodate me,” said Mr Ndlovu. <img class="alignnone wp-image-682697 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/faewewe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/faewewe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/faewewe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Elizabeth Ndebele (81) whose house was also damaged said she heard the noise of crumbling walls just by her bedside and was helpless. Mrs Ndebele said she can only hope it does not rain again as she now has no safe place to stay. “If only I had money I would be leaving this house because it is no longer safe but I have no choice but to continue being here. I can only pray the house does not totally fall apart while I am inside,” she said. <img class="wp-image-682699 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ioyluiku.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ioyluiku.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ioyluiku-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mrs Busisiwe Ncube Mrs Busisiwe Ncube (44) said parts of her home was destroyed on Friday and now looks like an old building that has no people residing in it. “I am scared of living in this house. I think my husband and I will have to consider moving from here and look for alternative accommodation because this one is no longer safe. Rain is supposed to be a blessing but at the moment it is a curse in my life because it has the potential of ending my life,” she said.–@flora_sibanda
