Da Silva was then escorted out of the home while holding onto the set of chains that kept her from fleeing for two decades. Authorities said Da Silva was dehydrated and hungry when they discovered her holed up inside the makeshift cell. Paramedics rushed her to Regional Hospital, where she remains under observation and is being treated for severe malnutrition. Da Silva’s mother reportedly kept her locked inside the home in response to the mental illness she battled after losing two children years ago. Police said that the mother chained da Silva and locked her in the room because it was ‘the only way’ to handle her aggressiveness. Authorities are still investigating the incident to determine if other people were also involved. – DailyMail
