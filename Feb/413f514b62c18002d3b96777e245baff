The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A SHURUGWI family lost about US$2 500 and other valuables to masked armed robbers who pounced on them at their homestead. The robbers, armed with a rifle, machetes and logs, tortured the husband and wife before robbing them.
Midlands police spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said the incident occurred last Wednesday at around 11PM. “The victims, Lawrence Musvibe (43) and his wife Lisa Manenji (38) of Chief Banga in Shurugwi were in their kitchen preparing supper when unknown men entered covering their faces with black masks and armed with a rifle, machetes and logs. The suspects demanded cash from the couple resulting in Musvibe handing over US$500 which was in his pocket,” said Insp Mahoko.  One of them turned to Mr Musvibe’s wife and started assaulting her with a log demanding more cash.
Fearing for their lives, the couple went to the bedroom where they gave the suspects US$1 920. The suspects later ransacked the house and took two cellphones and two solar lights before disappearing into the darkness.
Police are appealing to members of the public who might have information which may lead to the arrest of the culprits to contact any nearest police station. In another case, police in Silobela are investigating a case in which a 30-year-old man died on the spot after being assaulted with bricks and logs following an altercation involving a missing cellphone. <img class="size-large wp-image-522323" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/machete-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/machete.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/machete-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Machete Insp Mahoko said last week on Wednesday at around 9PM, Prince Mabhena died on the spot after he was attacked with bricks and logs over a missing cell phone. “The now deceased and his colleague only identified as Vee, confronted one Mlungisi Moyo who was seated at the doorstep of his shop over a missing cellphone,” said Inspector Mahoko. This led to a misunderstanding resulting in Vee stabbing Moyo twice in the shoulder with a knife.
Moyo fled and later sneaked into his shop. “At about 2AM, Mabhena forcibly entered Moyo’s shop and a fight broke out. Moyo ran away and the now deceased gave chase until he caught up with him. Moyo then hit Mabhena with a brick and a log and he fell down and died on the spot,” said Insp Mahoko. After committing the crime, Moyo fled from the scene but was later arrested.
