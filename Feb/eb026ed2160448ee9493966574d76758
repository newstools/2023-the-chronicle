The IBR Chromadek roofing sheets also come in various eye-catching colours. The name IBR has become a household name in the Zimbabwean building industry because the sheets, Q-tiles, and ridges are tailor-made to fit the customer’s design and specifications and are now very common on residential and commercial structures. The roofing sheets are premium, high-quality roofing products with all the advantages of being made of steel such as being light in weight, durable and strong, while still having the attractive appearance of regular tiles. They have no standard length or measurement but can be adjusted and cut to any length to suit the constructional preferences and requirements of a client, which is an added advantage.  Zimbuild is one of the leading private land developers and construction companies in the country delivering on housing. The country’s commercial and residential property market has weathered many storms as evidenced by the continuous presence of construction projects across the country. This positive development comes at a time when the construction sector is projected to continue growing, largely due to demand for offices, industrial and retail buildings as well as accommodation. The real estate sector in the country is offering a great investment opportunity for both corporates and individuals. The ongoing housing reform agenda also provides opportunities for the private sector to participate in infrastructural development projects. Housing delivery is one of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) pillars. <img class="wp-image-624166 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) The key drive, therefore, is to address the inadequacies pertaining to infrastructure and provide citizens with access to affordable and quality settlements in the country. The country is facing a national housing backlog of 1,5 million housing units and the Government is spearheading housing delivery through the construction of houses and flats for civil servants. Private land developers such as Zimbuild have been responsible for advancing the process of urbanisation in the country, assisting the Government to clear the housing waiting list backlog. Zimbuild managing director Mrs Rufaro Manzungu said she is excited to be playing a role in assisting the Government meet the housing demand by availing a plant that will result in locals getting quality and affordable roofing sheets on time. “Zimbuild has expanded its roofing business by adding more machines for IBR rolling and bending among other machines that produce IBR. We have invested US$200 000 into state-of-the-art Inverted Rib Box (IBR)equipment to manufacture roofing sheets that are designed for use on all types of buildings including residential and commercial at our Gweru plant,” she said. Mrs Manzungu said they are moving into the roofing business following the realisation that housing development is on the increase. She said the Second Republic has created a conducive environment that has seen a surge in diaspora remittances and renewed interest in property development by individuals and corporates in the country and therefore the need to have such an investment to benefit would-be property owners. “As Zimbuild, we have noted with great appreciation the surge in property development in the country. We are in the construction boom and not only the Government needs these sheets but corporates and individuals who are enjoying the construction boom,” said Mrs Manzungu. She said Zimbuild, a major player in the construction industry, sees more development spearheaded by the Second Republic under the NDS 1 and Vision 2030. “We are setting up this plant so that we save foreign currency from importing the IBR sheets from South Africa and elsewhere. That forex will be used for other things that benefit the Government and its people,” said the MD. Mrs Manzungu said their market will include Midlands, Matabeleland North and South provinces where the company is running various programmes. “We have programmes in Bulawayo, Hwange, Gwanda, and Gweru among other places and this plant is within proximity of our projects as well and that will cut production costs by more than a quarter,” she said. Mrs Manzungu said the company is riding on the call by President Mnangagwa for locals to build the country. “We have heard the calls to build the country we want on our own by President Mnangagwa and as indigenous business people, we have to play our part. We want to be able to produce sheets for at least 300 houses per month in Midlands, Matabeleland North and South to start with as we grow to feed the whole country,” she said. Mrs Manzungu said the new equipment is semi–automated and will see at least 30 people being employed. She said the broad profile of the IBR roofing sheets gives them excellent drainage characteristics and they are also     durable. “The equipment is state-of-the-art and is semi-automated. We will provide affordable roofing sheets for the people in the construction industry and we are looking at mass production so definitely there is a guarantee of job creation as well,” said Mrs Manzungu. “Zimbuild is well known for land development and as a contractor who is participating in national projects across the country, we have a role to play in developing the country.” Minister of National Housing and Social Amenities Daniel Garwe, said the Government is confident of surpassing its target of delivering 220 000 housing units by 2025 by partnering with the private sector. <img class="wp-image-619480 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-17-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Daniel Garwe He said it is a private-public-partnership, and the Government’s key role is to create an environment suitable for making housing delivery make sense.
