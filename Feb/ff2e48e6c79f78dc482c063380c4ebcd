The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter REGIONAL leaders are scheduled to meet the Zifa executive to discuss the rollout of the National League which the national association is planning to implement this year. The first division regions – Central, Eastern, Northern and Southern are reportedly against the introduction of the National League which is part of fulfilling the constitutional requirements. Regions, through their chairpersons are against the introduction of the National League which they propose should come in 2024. The National League was first mooted and adopted into the constitution in 2013 but successive administrations at the association have not been able to implement it. But Zifa is adamant that the National League will go ahead despite not addressing concerns raised by the regions, crucially the issue of funding for such a taxing league and today’s meeting in Harare is meant to iron out differences so that plans for the second tier are escalated. Zifa spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela confirmed today’s meeting which comes three days before an indaba meant to dissect the Zifa Restructuring Committee report. Zifa members will hold a two-day meeting that starts on Friday as the association tries to uphold time-lines suggested by the Zifa Restructuring Committee in trying to come up with a roadmap that should take Zimbabwean football out of the woods and back on the right track this year. <img class="wp-image-440374 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/xolisani.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/xolisani.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/xolisani-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Xolisani Gwesela As for the National League, Zifa said an interim Executive Committee for the second tier made up of regional committee members will be set. Each region will second two members to the interim committee. The introduction of the National Division One League will see two clubs relegated from the Premier Soccer League at the end of the season instead of four. Presently, each region — Central, Eastern, Northern and Southern — promotes a team each into the PSL. There have been arguments that more competitive leagues in the world have one promotional division contributing two clubs like the English Premiership and the Spanish La Liga.  Having at least 64 teams contributing four to the Premiership, has been viewed as one of the major reasons that have weakened the top flight league. The tally of at least 64 teams represents a potential four divisions, meaning clubs that should be playing Area Zone football find themselves at a higher league than reality. — @ZililoR.
