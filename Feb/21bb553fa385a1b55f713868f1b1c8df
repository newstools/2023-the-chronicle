THE Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) says the Deka Pipeline upgrading project in Matabeleland North, which is expected to be completed end of March, is now 85 percent complete. The development of the 42km pipeline project that connects Deka High Lift Pump Station to Hwange Power Station, is critical to enhancing operationalisation of the Hwange Thermal Power Station, which is being boosted with 600MW capacity under a US$1,4 billion investment. The scope of the project also includes the refurbishment of Hwange Water Treatment Plant and provision of three tap-off points for supply of raw water to the Deka community.  The Exim Bank of India is funding the US$48,1 million project. In an update, ZPC said: “ The Deka Upgrade Project is on schedule and is 85 percent complete and is on course to be completed by March 31, 2023”. The power utility said works include pipe laying and fitting, construction of the gravel access roads along the pipeline and excavation of the pipeline trench. The giant Hwange Thermal Power Station draws raw water for electricity generation and cooling from the Zambezi River and the Deka water project is crucial in that regard. <img class="wp-image-622975 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-29-16.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-29-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-29-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hwange Thermal Power Deka Pipeline will increase water supply to the power station from 3 500 cubic meters to 6 000 cubic meters per hour.
The massive power project is among the key projects being implemented to enable the country to be energy self-sufficient thereby contributing immensely to the aspirations of the National Development Strategy (NDS1) and Vision 2030. Government says steady availability of electricity is crucial to the attainment of NDS1 goals and an upper middle-income society by 2030. The Deka upgrade project started last October. Meanwhile, ZPC said the construction of new Ingagula houses is underway and is being implemented parallel to the Hwange extension project. <img class="wp-image-619465 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-16-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) Social amenities such as a shopping mall, clinics, schools and playing fields are being built. Last year, ZPC officials said US$87 million is required to construct the new residential area for its workforce, which would be relocated from Hwange’s Ingagula suburb situated near Hwange Thermal Power Station. The location is exposed to pollution due to its proximity to the massive power plant, which is undergoing expansion works.
