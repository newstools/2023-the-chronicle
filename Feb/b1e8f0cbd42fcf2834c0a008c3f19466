The Chronicle Angela Sibanda, Showbiz Correspondent THE month of March is set to mark a new journey for upcoming artists as they get to be part of yet another edition of Shake it and Stomp gala in Mpopoma suburb. Organised by Kaisa events and entertainment, the gala is a 2015 idea that started off as a weekly talent show competition for aspiring artists from Mpopoma and neighbouring communities who got the opportunity to showcase their talent and get stage experience. The event grew a little bigger when the organisers introduced appearances and performances by established local artists to motivate and inspire the young and upcoming artists. In an interview, one of the organisers Derrick Tembo said the Shake it and Stomp events that they have been hosting in local communities are aimed at fighting drug abuse and give young people something to be occupied with.  “We have been using the platform as a way of uplifting the youth with talent and helping them stay away from drugs and substance abuse for all these derail the upcoming artists as well as kill the future of the nation. “Shake it and Stomp also helps grow their careers through workshops and rehearsals,” he said. The overnight gala to be held at Mathonisa Beer Garden in Mpopoma on 4 March is part of the annual Shake it and Stomp festival that has been keeping locals entertained during the month of November. <img class="wp-image-633112 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/bar1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/bar1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/bar1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mathonisa Beer Garden The events have been attended by many on free admission but due to various reasons, this year’s edition will see the introduction of admission fees that are also meant to benefit artists.
