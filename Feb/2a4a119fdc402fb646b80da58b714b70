The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Commercial Rabbit Breeders Association (ZICORBA) says prospects for an upsurge in rabbit meat sales on the domestic market are high, amid increasing inquiries for supplies from food outlets, retail shops, and hospitality service providers. Rabbit farmers are already seized with implementing measures to boost output while enhancing quality standards through the adoption of breeding protocols in line with global best practice, according to ZICORBA president, Regis Nyamakanga. “Demand for rabbit meat on the local market is very firm such that we are failing to satisfy it, thanks to the sustained campaigns by ZICORBA and its partners to popularise the consumption of rabbit meat in the country over the past two years,” he said. <img class="wp-image-634126 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-33.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-33.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-33-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> THE Zimbabwe Commercial Rabbit Breeders Association (ZICORBA) “Early this year, we were approached by three Southern African countries requesting us to supply them with rabbit meat and we are in discussions with them. If the price is right, we will make a breakthrough into the export market over the next three to four months.” Mr Nyamakanga told Business Chronicle that rabbit breeding protocols, which will be launched within the next three months, were being validated by industry stakeholders. “Since the formal introduction of rabbit rearing in Zimbabwe two years ago, there has been an influx of farmers venturing into the lucrative cuniculture sector necessitating some form of self-regulation for the burgeoning industry,” he said. “Once the protocols are approved, we will create a database of all certified rabbit breeders in Zimbabwe to ensure that current and aspiring farmers buy breeding stock from credible sources. The list of certified breeders will be published on our website.  “The certified breeders will keep the particular breed of rabbits and follow the recommended standards and international best practice of rabbit breeding.” Meanwhile, Mr Nyamakanga said the cuniculture sector was this year expected to expand production on the back of strategic partnerships with a number of key organisations and the introduction of out-grower schemes in various parts of the country. “We anticipate rabbit production to increase from about 30 tonnes in 2022 to an estimated 50 tonnes in 2023. This is premised on a number of initiatives that we are actively pursuing,” he said. “Discussions are underway with potential partners to launch out-grower schemes across the country, which will not only significantly shore up our production but professionalise rabbit rearing in the country.” In view of the positive prospects for the sector, Mr Nyamukanga said a number of organisations with more membership have submitted proposals to partner with them in growing and marketing rabbits.  — @SikhulekelaniM1
