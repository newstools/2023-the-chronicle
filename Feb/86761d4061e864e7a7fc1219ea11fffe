ZIMBABWE WARRIORS midfielder Marshall Munetsi scored his fourth goal in France’s Ligue 1 as his Stade de Reims emerged 4-0 winners over Troyes on Sunday. Munetsi scored the opener 10 minutes into the game prior to turning the provider for a Myziane Maolida goal just before half-time. He was substituted just after the break. His side is on position 10 with 33 points from 23 games.  The midfilder’s impressive outings in Ligue 1 have seen the player linked with a move to England where Championship sides Burnley, Watford and Bournemouth who play in the English Premier League have been linked with the Zimbabwean international. Munetsi joined the French side in June 2019 from South African giants Orlando Pirates. He had made the switch to the Bucaneers in July 2016 from former National First Division side FC Cape Town, but spent the 2016/17 season on loan at Baroka. Elsewhere, Marvelous Nakamba managed to make his first start for Luton Town on Saturday. <img class="wp-image-681053 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Marshall-Munetsi-rounds-off-Troyes-goalkeeper.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Marshall-Munetsi-rounds-off-Troyes-goalkeeper.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Marshall-Munetsi-rounds-off-Troyes-goalkeeper-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marshall Munetsi rounds off Troyes goalkeeper Nakamba joined the second-tier side at the end of last month on a six-month loan deal from EPL side Aston Villa where he fell out of favour. In Spain, Tinotenda Kadewere came from the bench in Real Mallorca’s 2-0 defeat against Sevilla. The striker, who is on loan from Lyon, featured for 18 minutes in the defeat. Jordan Zemura had another decent outing in Bournemouth’s 1-1 draw against Newcastle in the English Premier League.
