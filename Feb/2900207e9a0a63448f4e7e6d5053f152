The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter A FORTNIGHT ago a number of emissaries were sent to inform this reporter about the sons and daughters from Emakhandeni suburb that he had unintentionally left out of the suburb’s most famous list. These include former Highlanders striker Abraham Mbaiwa, the netball playing sisters Michelle and Nicole Muzanenhamo who were groomed by another netball icon from the hood, Sister Connie. There are plenty others as well which may need part two of the column. <img class="wp-image-684296 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Gift-Banda-njube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Gift-Banda-njube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Gift-Banda-njube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gift Banda This week we are in Njube suburb, an area named after one of the royal sons of King Lobengula. Njube was the first son to be born after Lobengula became King. He, alongside Nguboyenja, was taken to the Lovedale Institute in the Eastern Cape by Rhodes to prevent the resuscitation of the Ndebele state.  This is a suburb that bred one of the nationally and internationally acclaimed award-winning theatre and dance groups, Umkhathi Theatre Works led by director and arts and theatre doyen Matesu Dube who is from the suburb’s E Square area where you also find journalists Ngqwele Dube and this writer. In this area you also find socialites Bruce Ngangezwe Khumalo and those two Rastamen known by every kombi driver using Luveve Road, Nqobizitha Ncube and Nhlanhla Sibanda. <img class="wp-image-682467 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/shlono.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/shlono.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/shlono-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nqobizitha ras Ncube E Square Luveve road is also home to the one and only Sydney ‘‘Bro Sido’’ Ncube. A few houses from Ngqwele’s home lived the late Thokozile Mathuthu, the former Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services. Arnold “Yaya” Sibanda a boxing coach at Njube Boxing Club completes the list. <img class="wp-image-684294 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ernest-Maphepha-Sibanda-njube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ernest-Maphepha-Sibanda-njube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ernest-Maphepha-Sibanda-njube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ernest Maphepha Sibanda As one moves along ‘‘Njube Main’’ towards the police station but still within E Square, two icons — the late charismatic former Highlanders player, manager and chairman Ernest “Maphepha” Sibanda and social football guru Madodana “Horsepower’’ Tshabangu, of the famous festive season Horsepower tournament. Goalkeepers coach Maurice Mukwati cannot be left behind when talking about sons and daughters of Njube. <img class="wp-image-682405 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dxfvgh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dxfvgh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dxfvgh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rahman Gumbo On the side of the Njube’s most famous football pitch, ‘“the desert’’ is Highlanders and national team legend, Rahman Gumbo, a multi-nation football championship-winning coach, his siblings who chose to play for Zimbabwe Saints Norman and Nkosana and Njube Sundowns founder Gift Banda, who is also the suburb’s representative in Parliament. <img class="wp-image-682464 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sieeelo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sieeelo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sieeelo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ngqwele Dube Former Njube Sundowns founding coach, the late Josh Mhizha hailed from Njube. Tough-as-teak former Njube Sundowns and Highlanders defender Danisa Phiri is Njube’s own, together with former Amazulu player Goodson Gama. The late and probably forgotten Bosso winger Aramu Tshuma shall forever remain a Njube boy. Highlanders’ board member Methuseli Mafu comes from F Square. <img class="wp-image-684317 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Sinikiwe-sneeze-Mpofu-njube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Sinikiwe-sneeze-Mpofu-njube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Sinikiwe-sneeze-Mpofu-njube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sinikiwe sneeze Mpofu Musician Don Gumbo of Ilanga is from Njube though Old Pumula residents will also lay claim to the legend. Sadly, Gumbo passed on in 1998. Another musician Ndatshi Mkhize also hails from Njube. Alexander Mhlanga, dance and choreographer expert and Iyasa dance queens Silethemba and Siphephiso Magonya all hail from Njube, so does former ZBC broadcaster Judith Goche and veteran engineer now with DStv, Moffat Phiri. <img class="wp-image-684320 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Thokozile-Mathuthu-Njube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Thokozile-Mathuthu-Njube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Thokozile-Mathuthu-Njube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thokozile Mathuthu A few weeks ago, the cricket community mourned the sudden passing on of a promising young coach who also represented the Lady Chevrons as a player, Sinikiwe “Sneeze” Mpofu. She was a cricketer to the world but for Njube in general and A Square in particular, Sneeze was a daughter, sister and a home girl. The late National University of Science and Technology (Nust) chemical engineer Dr Joel Tshuma remains a Njube icon. <img class="wp-image-682404 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ddfvghhh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ddfvghhh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ddfvghhh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Madodana Horsepower Tshabangu United States of America-based fringe Warriors player Joseph Ngwenya and former tennis national team player and now Classic 263 sportscaster, David Simba are both from Njube.
