ZIMBABWEAN all-rounder Sikandar Raza got his 2023 Pakistan Super League (PSL) campaign to a positive start after his team Lahore Qalandars won a thriller against Multan Sultans by one run on Monday at Multan Cricket stadium. Multan Sultans, winners of the PSL in 2021, are coached by Zimbabwean legend Andy Flower. The Chevrons star scored an unbeaten 19 runs off 14 deliveries as his team made 175/6 in 20 overs and did not take any wickets as they restricted their opponents to 174-6 in 20 overs as well to win it by the finest of margins.  Coming in to bat at number five, Raza’s innings consisted of one four and as many sixes at a strike rate of 135.71 percent. With the ball in hand, he gave away 32 runs in three overs at 10. 66 runs per over. Raza joined the defending champions of the league for the eighth edition of the decorated tournament after a stint with International League T20 (ILT20) side Dubai Capitals who failed to reach the final tournament that was won by Gulf Giants who defeated Desert Vipers by seven wickets in Sunday’s final. In Monday’s match, opening batter and Pakistan international Fakhar Zaman top scored for the Qalandars with 66 runs off 42 deliveries while his partner Mirza Baig scored 32 runs off 26 deliveries to finish as the team’s top scorers. Usama Mir and Ihsanullah took two wickets each for Sultans while Akeal Hosein  and Shahnawaz Dahani had one each.
Zaman’s effort saw him voted the Player of the Match. <img class="wp-image-680175 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jslkhfv.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jslkhfv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jslkhfv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sikandar Raza batting for Dubai Capitals The defence got off to a bad start for the defending champions as their opening pair of skipper Muhammad Rizwan and Shan Masood put out a 100 run first wicket partnership before the latter fell for 35 runs off 31 deliveries while Rizwan made 75 runs from 50 balls as they finished as the top scorers.
