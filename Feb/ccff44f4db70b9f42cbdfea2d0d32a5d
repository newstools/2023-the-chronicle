The Chronicle  Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Online Reporter THE Namibian Government has banned driving of second-hand in transit vehicles through that country and such vehicles will now only be transported on a car carrier trailer. The ban comes into effect on March 1, 2023. A number of Zimbabweans had been using the Walvis Bay port to receive their vehicles mainly from the United Kingdom and then drive through Namibia, a 2 400km journey to Harare or 1 800km to Bulawayo via Botswana. In a statement, the Namibian Revenue Authority (NamRA) said that luxury will no longer be in place as of next month. “The Namibian Revenue Authority herewith informs vehicle importers and the public that with effect from March 1, 2023, second-hand motor vehicles will be allowed to transit through Namibia only on a car carrier trailer and no second-hand motor vehicle will be allowed to transit on its own wheels,” read the NamRA notice.
