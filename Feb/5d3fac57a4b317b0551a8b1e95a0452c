The Chronicle “The eyes of the LORD are everywhere, keeping watch on the wicked and the good.”
Proverbs 15 : 3
I attended an exclusive event a few days ago that was very private and different from anything that I usually do. It was a new experience for me and I got to meet new people and see a different side of social gatherings that I found interesting. I did not see anyone that I knew there and I had a pleasant time indeed. To my surprise, the next day I received a text from someone I know saying they had seen me there and saying how they were surprised because they had never figured me for someone who enjoyed that kind of thing. <img class="wp-image-570964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> I was taken aback because I had not seen any familiar faces there nor did I expect to because it was something out of the ordinary for me. As I read that text I thought to myself, oh wow, what are the odds, imagine if I had behaved inappropriately thinking there was no one who knew me there. How many times have you done something wrong or acted out of turn because you thought no one could see you?
They say the true test of character is what you do when no one is watching. We tend to let our guard down when we think we are safe from prying eyes but someone is always watching. God is aware of everything, not just what’s going on outside but what’s in your heart and your mind; the attitudes, the motives and the feelings that no one else sees. There is no way to hide anything from Him. Therefore we must always seek to do the right thing, whether or not we have an audience. Our aim should be to do what is pleasing to God.  Look into the mirror of the soul today. Who are you? Is your life a benchmark of righteousness? Let us ask the Lord to help us do the right thing always, not only when all eyes are upon us, but even when no one is watching.
Be blessed
