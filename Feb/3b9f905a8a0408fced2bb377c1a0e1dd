The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent CATTLE rustlers are on the loose in the Midlands Province and some of them are so daring that they even slaughter beasts in kraals at night. The thieves are now supplying meat to butcheries and individuals. Last week a family in Lalapanzi lost six beasts which were slaughtered in the kraal. Police launched a manhunt which led to the arrest of a four-member gang that was caught redhanded skinning more stolen cattle at another kraal in the same area. Midlands police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the arrest of the four suspects. <img class="wp-image-677587 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-29-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-29-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-29-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko “Zimbabwe Republic Police confirm the arrest of four suspects in connection with stock theft cases in the Lalapanzi area.  They were arrested during the night of 28 January 2023,” said Insp Mahoko. Muruvi Muruvi (56), Evelyn Matoma whose age was not given, Godknows Dube (27) and Aaron Mpofu (68) were caught slaughtering stolen beasts from Plot 29 Hillaview in Lalapanzi. “On 28 January 2023 at around 10PM, Jonathan Phiri (62) was at his homestead when he heard noise of people who were slaughtering a beast coming from Muruvi’s kraal. He teamed up with his colleague and proceeded to Muruvi’s homestead and upon arrival they saw the four suspects slaughtering a beast and alerted the police,” he said. Acting on the information, police reacted swiftly and arrested the four suspects leading to the recovery of five stolen beasts on the scene. Last week, another family lost six cattle to thieves who slaughtered the cattle before taking the meat away. Another family in Ward 20 in Gokwe, reportedly lost two beasts and found knives and axes used by the thieves who were disturbed by a passerby while slaughtering the beasts. Police are urging members of the public to continue supplying information which assists in fighting crime such as stock theft. Meanwhile, Chief Njelele from Gokwe South district said cases of stock theft are rampant in his area. He said he lost three beasts to thieves. “We have been complaining about these cases for a while now and the trend of people selling meat everywhere is worrying. There are sprouting backyard kitchens in Gokwe town and council should play its part and investigate those kitchens,” said Chief Njelele. He said there is a need to control cattle movement. “We are in talks with the Veterinary department for the establishment of a centre where cattle can be sold legally with everyone witnessing. This may go a long way in curbing stock theft. The arrangement can also address the problem of spreading of diseases such as anthrax and January disease,” he said. Chief Njelele said it is worrying to note that people are moving livestock at night without permits. “I see cars carrying goats and cattle in the middle of the night. This should be stopped forthwith as  thieves are taking advantage of this laxity,” he said.
