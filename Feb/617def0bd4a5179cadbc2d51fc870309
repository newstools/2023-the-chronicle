FORMER Highlanders midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku made his Botswana Premiership debut appearance coming in the 70th minute for Jwaneng Galaxy who beat Rahman Gumbo’s Morupule Wanderers 3-1 at the Galaxy Stadium on Saturday. Masuku, who made a switch to Botswana came on as championship chasing Jwaneng Galaxy were leading 1-0 and they went on to turn up the heat as they handed Morupule Wanderers their second successive defeat. The win saw Jwaneng Galaxy climb to the top of the log before Gaborone United took on Security Systems yesterday.  Gumbo, who is yet to sit on the bench as he is waiting for his permit having joined the club last month, watched his side being pummelled from the terraces. While Jwaneng Galaxy took their unbeaten run to 14 games with 34 points, their opponents Morupule Wanderers stretched their winless streak to four games. Gumbo’s side last registered a victory on January 8 when they edged Mogoditshane Fighters 2-1. The result was followed by a 1-0 defeat to champions Gaborone United, a 1-1 draw against Extension Gunners, then a 1-3 home loss to the Mandla “Lulu” Mpofu coached Masitaoka and Saturday’s defeat to Jwaneng Galaxy. Morupule Wanderers are in position 10 with 15 points after 14 games, meaning that Gumbo has a mammoth task to turn the team’s fortunes. <img class="wp-image-670450 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/nhgfsdhgfhsdfghdfs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/nhgfsdhgfhsdfghdfs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/nhgfsdhgfhsdfghdfs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rahman Gumbo Next weekend Morupule Wanderers visit Nico United, formerly coached by Philani “Beefy” Ncube. Nico United seem to be getting their groove right as they are unbeaten in two matches. Last week they held championship chasing Jwaneng Galaxy to a 2-2 draw and on Saturday they beat Police XI 2-1. Former Zifa technical director Taurai Mangwiro kept Orapa United’s title hopes alive when they extended their winning run to six games with a 3-0 away win against BDF XI. <img class="wp-image-660910 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-3-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-3-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-3-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Taurai Mangwiro Orapa United are third on the table with 33 points from 14 games and are in title contention against Jwaneng Galaxy and defending champions Gaborone United. Mangwiro is enjoying a good spell, reinventing himself at Orapa United having left Harare City who were relegated from the Zimbabwean Premiership last season. — @ZililoR
