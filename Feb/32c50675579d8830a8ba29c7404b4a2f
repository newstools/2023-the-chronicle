The Chronicle Whether you are relaxing out in the sun, in the comfort of your backyard, resort place, or just an outdoor establishment, chances are that in the sunny days to come — that is if we are not swept away by floods from the heavy rains we are experiencing — you will definitely absorb some serious Vitamin D. Nothing is better than a refreshing drink in your hand while soaking up some rays. Not too much though, a little shade and rays could do the trick. The drink of choice would be the Bahama Mama. This cocktail will leave you feeling like you are at a beach in the Bahamas, even if the weather is not so happy. <img class="wp-image-682481 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hjcdbch.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hjcdbch.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hjcdbch-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bahama Mama What is a Bahama Mama, you ask? Let’s go back in time . . .
This spunky drink originated from the Bahamas, it is rumoured to be indirectly named after Dottie Lee Anderson, a Caribbean dancer, and performer in the 1930s, who also went by the stage name Bahama Mama. Another theory is that this cocktail became popular during Prohibition when the Bahamas were used as a rum smuggling base.
While there are many theories as to how this cocktail came to be, no one’s certain which is true. Anyway, according to the “barman’s logbook”, this isn’t a drink with any set rules. It’s the ideal drink you can have when you are sort of skint in your pockets. Most cocktails are draining on the finances but with this one it’s quite easy. With this one from my reading and tasting, it’s not really about the brand of alcohol but the taste and feel.  A lot of recipes call for name-brand alcohol, but most of us really can’t tell the difference between cheap and expensive liquor. This cocktail is perfect for when the party has already started and you don’t want to run out to the supermarket or your nearest bottle store or liquor supplies to buy ingredients.
Well, in the Bahamas this cocktail is served in a coconut. This cocktail will bring the taste of the tropics into your home, even when served in a glass but nothing stops you from buying a coconut from the supermarket or vegetable store. This drink is mainly for those who just want to lay back and tap into their lazy mode. The ingredients are quite simple. You need a serving of ice ½ a thimble of coffee liqueur, a thimble of dark rum, 1 thimble coconut liqueur, ½ thimble white rum, or your usual cane spirit. Lemon juice is essential for the tropical flavouring and zing, and pineapple slices and berries for the garnish. So, once you have the ingredients, pour all of them into a cocktail shaker with ice. After you have shaken well, pour the contents into a glass and add crushed ice.
