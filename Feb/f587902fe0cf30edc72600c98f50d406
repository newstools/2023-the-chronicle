The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter SHE came, she saw, and she conquered.
Former Zimbabwe women’s cricket fast bowler, Sarah Dambanevana wrote her own piece of history when she stood in the final of the first-ever International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s Under-19 T20 World Cup last month in South Africa. She umpired the final between India and England at JB Marks Oval in Potchefstroom, South Africa which India won by seven wickets to become the first female Zimbabwean to stand in a World Cup final match.
As a member of the International Panel of ICC Development Umpires, Dambanevana made history alongside Candace la Borde from West Indies as ICC named an all-female team to stand in the historic final. <img class="wp-image-682458 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/xffdvfd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/xffdvfd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/xffdvfd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Former Zimbabwe women’s cricket fast bowler, Sarah Dambanevana She was also involved in the semi-finals when she and La Borde stood as umpires in the match between England and Australia. Another Zimbabwean, Owen Chirombe also took part in the semi-final match as the match referee but was not selected for the final.
Dambanevana played for the national team until 2013 before switching over to officiating and was appointed among the 15 personnel that officiated at the inaugural World Cup. The 32-year-old former Lady Chevrons bowler also made history last year after she became the first female to officiate in a domestic cricket final match during last season’s Fifty50 Challenge. After seven months, in October, she again made history as the first female to stand in a men’s List A match when Rhinos and Eagles played at Kwekwe Sports Club.  Dambanevana started playing cricket when she was still in high school in 2007 for the Midlands women’s team, now Rhinos Women. She was selected for the national team for the first time in 2009 in preparation for the regional ICC Women’s World Cup qualifiers which were held the following year in Kenya. In line with ICC’s development strategy, nine out of the 15 officials at the World Cup were women, making it the highest number of female match officials to be appointed for an ICC event and her rise to the top at the global showpiece speaks to the development and growth of women’s cricket in Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-682454 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ljhg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ljhg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ljhg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sarah Dambanevana at ICC U19 World Cup Women’s cricket is one of the fastest-growing sports in the country as there now is a national Under-19 side, a senior national team that is doing well, and a domestic league that is running across formats.
Some female officials like Julia Chibhabha and Emily Jinjika are also looking to become international referees. On the men’s side, the country has the likes of Langton Rusere who is now on the international panel of bilateral cricket, Emmanuel Dube, who is also making strides as an international referee, I know Chabi, who officiated in the first Test between Zimbabwe and West Indies at Queens Sports Club and Chirombe as well. <img class="wp-image-682452 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/pjkhjk.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/pjkhjk.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/pjkhjk-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dambanevana made history alongside Candace la Borde from West Indies as ICC named an all-female team to stand in the historic final Zimbabwe also had a team at the inaugural World Cup which however, did not produce good results. The Young Lady Chevrons who were under the captaincy of Kelsi Ndhlovu lost all four matches they played. They were up against England, Pakistan, Rwanda, and Indonesia. –@brandon_malvin
