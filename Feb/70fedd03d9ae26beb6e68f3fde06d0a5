The Chronicle Basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal has lashed out at musician Rihanna’s critics after making an appearance at the Super Bowl. O’Neal argues that all those people who criticised the singer are disrespectful and they must just shut up. The 50-year-old four-time NBA champion came to Rihanna’s defence on The Big Podcast with Shaq Friday, sending a message to all of her critics to “shut the f— up” about her Super Bowl display. <img class="wp-image-683440 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-21-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-21-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-21-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rihanna: Pictures from celebmafia.com “All you people disrespecting Rihanna, shut your face. Shut it up,” O’Neal said. “We living in a world where people got too much freedom, keep your f–ing thoughts to yourself.” “She did a wonderful job. She’s pregnant, she blessed it, she did her thing, she didn’t fall. Just leave it there. All you superstars that’s disrespectful and causing beef, shut your face.”  O’Neal said that the Super Bowl was his first time seeing Rihanna live, even though he’s been a fan of hers for years, and said that he thought she did a “great job.” He also lambasted the people who were taking issue with her from behind their Twitter screens, rather than to her face as he suggested they should have done. O’Neal said if he was dating the nine-time Grammy-winning artist — who turned 35 Monday — he would have to “get at” her haters. “If she was my woman and I saw one of you superstars do that, I’m gonna have to get at you,” he said. “Rappers. Presidential candidates. I’m gonna have to get at you. Leave her alone.” <img class="wp-image-683443 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-22-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-22-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-22-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rihanna: Pictures from celebmafia.com While not explicitly stating it, O’Neal may have been referring to former President Donald Trump’s tweet slamming the “Diamond” singer’s performance where he stated her show was “the single worst Halftime Show in Super Bowl history” and critiqued her for using “foul and insulting language.” The “insulting language” in question may be referring to a 2020 photo where Rihanna posed beside a spray-painted car that said “F— Trump.” The singer has also been vocal about her disdain for Trump in addition to the photo.
