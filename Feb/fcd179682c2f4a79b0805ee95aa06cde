The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter ‘WE Are Victoria Falls Initiative’, an independent body established to disseminate information to help build the destination brand, has set up a board chaired by tourism executive, Mrs Barbara Murasiranwa-Hughes. The local public-private sector crisis communication initiative works closely with the Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism, and Hospitality Industry, supported by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation to represent the community of Victoria Falls during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. It buttresses the need for up-to-date information on destination management of the pandemic, collecting and disseminating information on external trade sentiment to aid preparedness and response while reinforcing brand position of the destination. The campaign was implemented in phases and Ms Shelly Cox, a local tourism executive, is the coordinator and consultant, as well as the board secretary.  The initiative has more than 300 members who voted for the new board.
