The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) is targeting to migrate all the 103 000 remaining domestic power users to prepaid system by the end of June which it says will improve energy use efficiency. The power utility also intends to install smart meters for industrial clients who consume more power as most of them are on post-paid electricity system. Yesterday, ZETDC launched a smart meter system programme in partnership with Bulawayo City Council (BCC) that will see 8 000 industrial clients in the southern part of the country being shifted to the new system. ZETDC has since 2012 connected 750 000 domestic power consumers to the prepaid electricity and is working on connecting the remaining 103 000.  Speaking during the launch of the smart meter system in Bulawayo yesterday, ZETDC western region general manager Engineer Lloyd Jaji, who was standing in for the company’s executive chairman Dr Sydney Gata, said the roll out of the prepayment system speaks to the utility’s aim to improve efficiency in the electricity consumption. “This is a move which forms key building blocks towards a smart grip. The step is coming at a right time when the Government of Zimbabwe through Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) is addressing issues to do with revenue assurance, debt collection and inefficiencies in collection among many objectives. This is also meant to address security of electricity supply making the utility more customer centric,” said Eng Jaji. He said there is a need to ensure all power consumers pay for electricity before using it.
“The remaining number although smaller compared to the installed numbers, generate a greater portion of the revenue streams as this group of clients consist of maximum demand clients and commercial points. It is therefore imperative that these points be migrated to the prepaid metering platform without delay,” said Eng Jaji. <img class="size-large wp-image-682162" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ffrrdweas-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ffrrdweas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ffrrdweas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZETDC roll out launch the meter He said the power utility company has since resumed the prepaid meter installation starting with residential clients and small business units. Eng Jaji said ZETDC procured the balance of the prepaid meters and the western region requires at least 40 000 prepaid meters for domestic clients. “The region will also install 8 000 smart meters to high priority customers and those customers with negative debt history. The region will also be rolling out prepaid meters to over 36 000 customers who for a long time have been on looped connections and those load limited which dates back to the colonial era,” said Eng Jaji. <img class="size-large wp-image-541069" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ZESAQ-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZETDC Some of the houses that will be connected under the programme include semi-detached houses in suburbs such as Mzilikazi, Makokoba, Entumbane, Iminyela, Emabutweni and Old Lobengula. Eng Jaji said the programme is expected to be completed by June.
“The utility is expecting that by the end of the second quarter, every client on the post- paid platform will have been moved to the prepaid meter system,” he said. Eng Jaji said the prepaid system comes with a number of benefits which include the ability to manage one’s electricity bill, customer convenience through various channels of payment including paying online,
elimination of estimated bills and the end of invasion of privacy by meter readers. “The meters come with new user-friendly features like Bluetooth at a time when the utility is fostering digital transformation for improved client convenience. We are happy that the roll out of advanced metering technology will set a positive tone for the token identifier which is coming on the 11 of November 2024,” said Eng Jaji. Speaking during the event Bulawayo Mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni who was represented by his deputy, Clr, Mlandu Ncube commended the cooperation between the two service providers saying installation of precision multifunction meters is important in serving communities. <img class="size-large wp-image-663409" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-3-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-3-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-3-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mayor Solomon Mguni He said the council welcomes the smart meter as it allows the local authority to better manage its power consumption.
“The precision multifunction meters are a powerful tool that are capable of measuring a wide range of parameters, including voltage, current, power, energy, frequency and power factors. This is key in ensuring that we use our electricity efficiently,” he said. Clr Mguni said the new system will enable council to accurately monitor and analyse its systems which will help it to make informed decisions or take prompt action. He said the smart meters can be read remotely, which provides an added level of safety for operators thereby reducing risk of accidents and injuries. Clr Mguni said the project is also in sync with council vision of being a leading smart and transformative city by 2024.
“I am confident that we will see the benefits of these meters in action in the coming weeks and months. This precision multifunction meter is an excellent example of how collaborations between different entities can bring positive change to our communities,” he said. -@nqotshili
