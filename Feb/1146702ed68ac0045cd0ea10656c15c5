Rheumatic heart disease is heart valve damage due to rheumatic fever and the condition can lead to serious health problems, including heart failure. Medication and surgery are the main treatments. Ms Lulu Phiri said her son needs funds to go to India for surgery and treatment. Her son, the second born in a family of three was admitted to the United Bulawayo Hospitals in December after his condition became worse and his body started swelling. <img class="wp-image-608494 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-7-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) Ms Phiri said her son had a bacterial infection called Strep throat when he was still in primary school and doctors said he had to take medication for a period of time.  She said after taking all the required medication her son stopped the treatment when he was 19 and they thought he was now fine. “In July last year, his body started swelling and we took him to a doctor who told us he should not have stopped the medication because it had led to his valve collapsing. Ever since that time he is always sick and we have been buying medication so that the pain is contained,” said Ms Phiri. She said doctors have been trying to drain water from his body as the valve is no longer functioning. Ms Phiri said doctors told her the only place that her son could be helped is in India as a result she should look for funds as soon as possible as his condition is getting worse. “Mthabisi is surviving by taking pills and an injection three times a day. At the moment he is really sick and has been admitted to the hospital because his body is swollen and he has not been urinating. His doctors have inserted a tube in his body so that it can help to drain the water,” she said. <img class="size-large wp-image-531598" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/injection-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/injection.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/injection-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> injection The woman said the money that is needed covers travel and hospital bills and accommodation for her son.
