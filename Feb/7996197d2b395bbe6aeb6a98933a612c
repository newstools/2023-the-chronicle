AFTER a long day’s work spent weeding his fields, Mr Cleopas Ndlovu (48) sits under the shade of a tree to take a well-deserved break. He scrolls through his phone and comes across a message that leaves him weary. The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has just sent an SMS, warning of impending heavy rains and a possibility of flash floods in the south-western parts of the country. With the MSD and the Civil Protection Unit (CPU) having issued a warning of floods in the past week, people have been advised to be on the lookout. <img class="alignnone wp-image-464491 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/msd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/msd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/msd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The MSD sternly put the word out that the public is warned of heavy rains and flash floods expected in the south-western parts of the country from 9 to 15 February. Another warning was circulated highlighting that from 16 to 20 February, heavy rains were expected in the provinces of Matabeleland North, South and Bulawayo. “Localised heavy rains in excess of 50 millimetres with lightning and hailstorm will in some places result in rooftops being blown off causing loose debris while trees may fall due to strong winds. Open drains and potholes that may be covered in water are some of the things to watch out for,” said the MSD in a statement. The forecasts have been circulating with high hopes that as many villagers as possible receive the information.
Mr Ndlovu is a smallholder farmer at Tshino Village in Tsholotsho District, Matabeleland North province. He has spent his lifetime tilling the same land inherited from his grandparents. As he reads the message, he wipes sweat off his brow. Villagers are unsettled by such information. The floods alert remind Mr Ndlovu of the 2015 and 2017 rainy seasons when at one time, some farmers from neighbouring villages were forced to relocate to higher ground following days of incessant rains. Some were marooned and lost property and livestock.  The CPU always advises people to move to higher ground whenever a threat of floods is in sight. That is possible if early warning systems are distributed well in time for people to evacuate to safer spaces. Disaster risk experts say early warning systems are integral in helping people get important and timely information before a disaster in order to make informed decisions. Through early warning campaigns, it becomes easier for authorities to manage anxiety and panic in areas such as Tsholotsho. In certain parts of this semi-arid area of Matabeleland North province, during the wet season, there gathers an aura of distress whenever news of heavy rains accompanied by thunder and lightning are about to hit the area. The fear of heavy rains is inherent among villagers in Tsholotsho, such that it has disturbed their way of living.
This is a place where farmers welcome the rains half-heartedly, especially when there is a floods forecast. If ever there is a warning, villagers know the rains come with flash floods that leave a trail of destruction. Homesteads are damaged and many are left destitute. <img class="alignnone wp-image-482440 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/flash-floods.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/flash-floods.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/flash-floods-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Villages at risk in Tsholotsho include those in Tshino, Shaba, Dikili, Dogwe, Nata, Malila, and Mathe, Tamuhla, Mbamba, Siphepha, Jimila, Mahlasi, Mathaba, Maphili and Mbanyana. Villagers say it has been like this for ages. They have lived to face off flooding and being “robbed” by the rains.
Mr Ndlovu and his neighbours have to rely on the MSD and the CPU and trust their recommendations. Generations of peasant farmers have passed on the same land prone to floods. Yet, few have ever eked out a bounty of harvest owing to floods. Following the flooding of Gwayi River during the first week of February, disaster management plans have been laid, according to Mr Aaron Gono, the Tsholotsho District Development Co-ordinator. “In terms of preparedness and recovery, we are on high alert,” he said.
In order to allay natural disasters such as floods, in 2019, the MSD and other stakeholders adopted a concept note titled: “A community-based flood and drought monitoring and early system for Zimbabwe,” where it was agreed that early warning systems have to be done working with communities at risk. “The overall objective is to reduce vulnerability of communities in Zimbabwe, to floods and drought by providing effective floods, drought monitoring and early warning tools,” reads the document.
Every year, the MSD warns people staying in low lying areas such as those in some parts of Tsholotsho to be wary of floods. As of last November, bulk messages informing people to be on the alert for disasters that come with rains have been streamed. For villagers in Tsholotsho and surrounding settlements, the messages are a reminder of that “nightmarish” season when cyclones take their toll. But experts say the solution to allay that fear and prevent the disastrous effect of such natural disasters, lies in effective early warning systems in disseminating information. “The solution to prevent calamity lies in maintaining a seamless flow of early warning systems, in a way that farmers and other settlers would understand,” said Dr John Motsi, a climatologist and disaster risk management consultant based in Bulawayo. Since the turn of the 2000s, the greater part of Tsholotsho has encountered the devastating effects of floods. Overwhelming evidence points to the need to pace up disaster risk preparedness measures that incorporate villagers and crucial disaster mitigation agencies such as the CPU. In the 2021-2022 season, Government came up with a national contingency plan that tackled the backlog in infrastructure that was damaged by natural disasters and in need of rehabilitation.
Mr Nathan Nkomo, director of the CPU, while acknowledging that his department is resource-constrained, is on record saying efforts towards strengthening early warning systems must be boosted. “On the early warning systems, it is agreeable that we have done our best in sending warnings to communities at risk. Using all the available channels through SMS and social media sites, the alerts have reached many,” he said.
Plans are afoot to construct evacuation centres in flood prone areas, Mr Nkomo said. But, even if the MSD delays in issuing early warnings, villagers have mastered their own way.
They have crafted indigenous knowledge systems of studying weather patterns by simply observing nature. The use of indigenous knowledge systems in communal lands has also hyped up the campaign to get villagers in the know of what they must anticipate. Even the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, Climate and Rural Development has strengthened its hold in keeping farmers in check through giving flood warnings whenever necessary. Agricultural extension officers, traditional leadership and some influential members of society have helped in raising awareness on floods. While human life takes precedence, farmers must not forget the well-being of their livestock. Some time in 2015, a torrential storm hit a village and farmers lost a herd of 3 000 cattle, 3 000 goats and 110 donkeys. This time, Mr Ndlovu is certain the effects of the rains would be minimal, since they now have all the information needed to prepare themselves. As he contemplates on the days ahead, his immediate move is to help other villagers receive the flood warning advice before disaster strikes.
