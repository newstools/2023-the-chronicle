While the youth of yesterday took up arms, today you must use our skills and talents to accelerate the growth of the economy,” said President Mnangagwa. “The baton stick is now in your hands. Like the youth that fought for independence, you the youth of today, must work harder for your own victory, a victory of development and prosperity of Zimbabwe we all want.”  The President reminded the youth that no matter the circumstances the country may face, they should always bear in mind that Zimbabwe is their only home. “No one will build our country for us. It is a responsibility that we, Zimbabweans must bear. Ilizwe lakhiwa, libuswa ngabaninilo/nyika inovakwa, inotongwa nevene vayo. We must build it brick by brick, stone upon stone,” he said. President Mnangagwa said his administration remains committed to playing its part to facilitating a higher quality of life and a brighter and more prosperous future for the youth. “Under the Second Republic, we will continue to avail opportunities for you the youth to realise your full potential. The devolution and decentralisation policy is ensuring that young people have access to quality social services such as education and health facilities,” he said. President Mnangagwa said the country’s colonial history must never be forgotten. <img class="wp-image-683425 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-16-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-16-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-16-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa “Our country’s colonial history must never be forgotten.
