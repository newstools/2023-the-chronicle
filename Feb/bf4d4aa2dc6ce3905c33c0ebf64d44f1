Ms Mazibuko said the conference is also meant to inspire women who are not in business to venture into business. “I borrowed the idea from Olinda Chapel who has done exceedingly well in her business and has managed to connect people through such events,” said Ms Mazibuko. She said the conference is open to women who are already in business and those aspiring to venture into business. Ms Mazibuko said a UK-based Tsholotsho woman bought five tickets for tomato vendors to attend and benefit from the conference. She said Ms Isabel Ndlovu said she bought the tickets for the vendors because she believed they will benefit from the conference. — @SikhulekelaniM1
