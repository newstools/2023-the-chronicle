The Chronicle Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter THE cash-strapped Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has asked companies to contribute towards the resuscitation of Central and Centenary Parks along Leopold Takawira Avenue Extension as part of their social corporate responsibility. The recreation parks, which were once the epicentre of entertainment and relaxation in Bulawayo with scenic views and lush lawns for people to unwind during their spare time, are now an eyesore. The parks have also turned into no-go areas particularly at night due to muggings. In April 2020, a local resident fatally stabbed a thug who was trying to rob him at Centenary Park. The unidentified man died on the spot. <img class="size-large wp-image-681654" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-9-copy-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-9-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-9-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Bongiwe Ngwenya The ponds that once swelled with fish have run dry and the duck enclosure now has an unbearable stench.
The once lush green lawns have been replaced by overgrown and unkempt grass. The park’s famed fountain, once an attraction for photo shoots, is no longer functioning and what is left is stagnant water which is now a breeding place for mosquitoes. BCC corporate communications officer, Ms Bongiwe Ngwenya said council is appealing to companies to assist in sprucing up the parks. “We have approached the corporate world to chip in so that we resuscitate the Central and Centenary Parks as part of their social corporate responsibility and these engagements are still underway,” she said. Ms Ngwenya said council needs money to drill more boreholes and equip them with sprinklers as well as landscape the parks in order to improve the aesthetics.  “The revitalisation of the parks also requires the procurement of equipment such as ride-on mowers to maintain the grass which has overgrown,” she said. Ms Ngwenya urged members of the public to help preserve the infrastructure through curbing desecration of the place, littering as welll as illegal picking and dropping of passengers. Central and Centenary Parks have been turned into illegal pick-up points by operators of long-distance buses that ply the Bulawayo-Beitbridge Road. This has resulted in the two recreational parks losing their allure due to the violation of the city’s by-laws.
“For us to resuscitate the parks, we have to make sure that there is a sustainable water source to irrigate the lawns and support the planting of flowers, trees and shrubs,” said Ms Ngwenya. She said due to financial challenges related to revenue inflows, council is struggling to refurbish sewage treatment works which would result in adequate water supply at the two recreational parks. Ms Ngwenya said the local authority has drilled two boreholes at the parks to augment water supplies but needs more.
She said about $200 million has been set aside for park development purposes this year. “The collapse of the irrigation water system at our parks is due to the decaying infrastructure emanating from the natural wear and tear. It should be noted that parks were irrigated using reclaimed water from our Thorngrove sewage treatment plant, which is now old,” said Ms Ngwenya. “All our recreational parks and other social amenities need a new lease of life through renewed investment. The park belongs to the citizens of Bulawayo and therefore let us preserve the infrastructure.” Ms Ngwenya said while the council is trying to maintain the facilities with subdued resources, it is also residents’ duty to keep them clean. <img class="size-large wp-image-681652" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-7-copy-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-7-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-7-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Central Park along Leopold Takawira Avenue Extension In separate interviews, residents shared their sentiments reminiscing about the past.
Mr Butholezwe Msimanga (64) from Emakhandeni suburb said during the colonial era, only whites were allowed to spend time at the two recreational parks. “It was known back then that only white people had the privilege to relax and have picnics at the park. During that period the park was kept clean and beautiful. It was infact the pride of the city,” he said. Mr Msimanga said the colonial government later relaxed council by-laws to allow blacks to use the recreational facilities. Ms Langelihle Mpofu (58) of Burnside suburb said Central and Centenary Parks used to be very beautiful and clean.
“At Central and Centenary Parks, you would find couples enjoying picnics on the green and well-kept lawns. The stunning flowers also complemented the beauty of the parks,” she said. “The park was my favourite spot for relaxing and clearing my mind but what is left now are just fond memories. I do not even remember the last time I went there because the place is now filthy and there is a stench emanating from flowing raw sewage.”
Ms Mpofu said the place is no longer safe because of vagrants and criminals who have turned it into their hunting ground.
