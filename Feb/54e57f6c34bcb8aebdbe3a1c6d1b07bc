CLAD in a pair of denim jeans and a cap, one would easily mistake her for a traffic cop as she cheerfully controls traffic at a pedestrian crossing on Old Esigodini Road in Ilanda suburb in Bulawayo. The woman has become a common feature on the busy road during the morning rush hour between 7AM and 8AM even when it is very cold or raining. With gusto and a beaming face, she assists school children and the elderly to cross the road.
Meet Mrs Rose Blair (68), a woman from Ilanda suburb who has taken it upon herself to assist school children cross a zebra pedestrian crossing leading to Tennyson Primary School. <img class="alignnone wp-image-679795 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hghfvgfvgyhhjn.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hghfvgfvgyhhjn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hghfvgfvgyhhjn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Many traffic accidents have been recorded at this pedestrian crossing as motorists used to ignore the zebra crossing sign. Cars are supposed to give way to pedestrians but many were not hence the many accidents that were being witnessed in the past. Mrs Blair, a retired accountant, started to assist the Tennyson Primary School pupils in 2019 after noticing that they were struggling to cross the road. Every morning, she beckons motorists to stop to allow pupils or the elderly to cross the road. Mrs Blair now has a reflective vest as well as a stop sign provided by local residents which makes it easier for her to control traffic. She abandoned her walking exercise routine four years ago to help the elderly and pupils to cross the road.
Mrs Blair said the idea came after spotting children and the elderly struggling to cross the road during her daily walking exercise.  “I do this service for free as a way of protecting the children and the elderly from being hit by cars. I ensure they cross safely without any hassles on their way to school. The only payment that l get is the hugs and smiles from the children who appreciate my service,” she said with a chuckle. Mrs Blair said when she started the initiative she did not have any traffic signs or protective clothing to put on, making it difficult for her to control traffic. “I was assisted by some members of the community who recognised my service and decided to chip in by donating reflective vests and a stop sign,” she said. Mrs Blair said initially motorists used to give her a hard time as many were ignoring her.
“Some motorists would tell me to my face that I was wasting their time and creating unnecessary traffic jam but I have learnt to tolerate them. My wish is to have a platform where I can teach people about the importance of helping children cross roads,” she said.  Mrs Blair said she hopes to get the police and Bulawayo City Council involved in ensuring that zebra crossings are  safe crossing points for all pedestrians, especially children. “The safety of school pupils should be a priority for every community hence need for motorists to observe zebra crossings,” she said. Mrs Sihle Nyoni whose granddaughter is also benefiting from Mrs Blair’s service, said: “Most motorists now comply when she stops them so I no longer worry about the safety of my granddaughter when she is crossing this busy road.” A motorist, Mr Edward Ndlovu, said he is impressed that most motorists now appreciate what Mrs Blair is doing hence are complying when she stops them. “When l first saw her a few years back trying to control traffic, l was actually nervous knowing how some reckless drivers behave, especially when it comes to obeying traffic rules and regulations. We have drivers who don’t stop at zebra crossings,” he said. Mrs Ndlovu said what Mrs Blair was doing was a great service to the community and she needs everyone’s support.
In 2017 a Grade Five pupil from Gampu Primary School was hit by a kombi at a zebra crossing along Luveve road and died on the spot.@flora_sibanda
