What is nursing?
21st Century nursing is the cement that holds a patient’s health care journey together. Crosswise the entire patient experience, and wherever there is someone in need of care, nurses work diligently to identify and protect the needs of the individual. Nursing encompasses autonomous and collaborative care of individuals of all ages, families, groups and communities, sick or well and in all settings. Nursing includes the promotion of health, prevention of illness, and the care of ill, disabled and dying people. <img class="wp-image-618382 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-63-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-63-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-63-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Health care However, nursing has a unifying ethos: In assessing a patient, nurses do not just consider test results. Through the critical thinking exemplified in the nursing process, nurses use their judgment to integrate objective data with subjective experience of a patient’s biological, physical and behavioral needs. This ensures that every patient, from city hospital to community health center; state prison to summer camp, receives the best possible care regardless of who they are, or where they may be. What exactly do nurses do?
In a field as varied as nursing, there is no typical answer. Responsibilities can range from making acute treatment decisions to providing inoculations in schools. The key unifying characteristic in every role is the skill and drive that it takes to be a nurse. Through long-term monitoring of patients’ behavior and knowledge-based expertise, nurses are best placed to take an all-encompassing view of a patient’s wellbeing.  What types of nurses are there?
All nurses complete a rigorous program of extensive education and study, and work directly with patients, families, and communities using the core values of the nursing process. Today, nursing can be divided into three categories by the specific responsibilities they undertake i.e GNs, PCNs, Nurse Assistants/Aides, Patient Care Technicians or Occupational Health Nurses. CPD accredited Nurse Assistants/ Aides and Patient Care Technicians are also offered at Ocean Bird Foundation International.
