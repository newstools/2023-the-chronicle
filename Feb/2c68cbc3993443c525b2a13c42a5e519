He said a search to locate the body is underway. “Search teams are still on the ground after having failed to locate the body on the same day,” he said.  Mr Mpungu, who is also Kwekwe District Development Coordinator emphasised the need to exercise extreme caution amid heavy rains that have been pounding the country lately. “We take this opportunity to advise all schools not to allow pupils to cross flooded rivers. People staying in low lying areas like Silobela and Empress that are more prone to flooding should always be on the outlook. “Those staying near water bodies like rivers and dams, should also be on high alert and should move to higher ground in case of flooding,” he said. <img class="wp-image-607002 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The government declared the floods a national disaster Mr Mpungu also warned miners against going underground during the rainy season. “The CPU strongly advises against underground mining activities especially between 25 February and 3 March 2023. Our artisanal miners are advised to suspend underground mining activities to allay any eventualities,” he said. He also urged local authorities to work on all drainage systems to allow free flow of water and avoid flash flooding.
