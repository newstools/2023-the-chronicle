The Chronicle Mkhululi Ncube, Chronicle Reporter Plumtree town council has imposed heavy fines for farmers whose livestock stray into the town. Cattle and donkeys are a common site in Plumtree town which is surrounded by farms. In a notice to farmers seen by Chronicle, Acting Town Secretary Mr Thembelani Nyoni said farmers will be charged US$10 for a stray beast per day. <img class="alignnone wp-image-633577 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/money-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/money-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/money-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A stray donkey will also attract a fine of US$10; goat, US$5 and chicken, US$2 per day. “Farmers and the general public are advised that with effect from February 13, 2023, all stray animals will be impounded in line with SI 102 of 2015, Protection of Lands and Natural by Law as read with Stock Trespass Act 19:14,” said Mr Nyoni. Plumtree Town Council is surrounded by Bililima and Mangwe Rural District Councils which are well known for livestock farming. A farmer from Diba village Mr Phineas Nkomo said the move was going to be costly to farmers. He bemoaned vandalism of the highway fence which was erected by the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe in a bid to stop livestock from straying into the highway. <img class="wp-image-523269 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/The-Zimbabwe-Traffic-Safety-Council-of-Zimbabwe-TSCZ.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/The-Zimbabwe-Traffic-Safety-Council-of-Zimbabwe-TSCZ.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/The-Zimbabwe-Traffic-Safety-Council-of-Zimbabwe-TSCZ-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ) “US$10 dollars per day is too much because many famers have no grazing areas near their homesteads and they rely on farms near the town for grazing. Due to long distances from our homestead we are not able to guard the cattle everyday hence they roam freely. I understand it is not an ideal situation to have livestock in towns but the amount is very punitive. The government should take stern measures against people who vandalised the fence which kept our cattle from reaching the town and the tarred road,” he said. Another farmer from the Zimnyama area Mr Melusi Sithole said there is need for council to engage farmers before implementing the policy.  He said many farmers were going to lose their cattle as they were going to struggle to raise the money. “The amount is too much because if your cattle go missing and find their way to the CBD and they keep them for some days one will be forced to sell one to raise the money to pay council. We hope council will delay this and engage us so that we find a better solution or they reduce the amount,” he said.
