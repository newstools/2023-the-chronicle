YOUNG tennis sensation Emmly George has been selected to represent Zimbabwe at the Africa Junior Championships (AJC) set for March 15-22 in Togo. At just the age of 12, the young tennis star will don national colours at the Under-14s level. The tournament will start with a warm up event from March 11-14 before the main championship takes place a day later. Inspired by American teenager Cori Dionne “Coco” Gauff and Swiss maestro Roger Federer, the youngster is no stranger to representing Zimbabwe at the biggest stages having been before taking part in international tournaments over the years.  The selection to the national team comes after George, who started playing tennis at the age of five is set to be honoured by her club at Bulawayo Athletic Club (BAC) this evening as the best club junior player.
