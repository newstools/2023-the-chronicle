The Chronicle Mkhululi Ncube, Chronicle Reporter PUPILS from Ntobi Village in Bubi District, Matabeleland North Province, have not been attending classes for almost a month as they cannot cross the flooded Mbembesi River to Dabengwa Secondary School. Parents said they fear the prolonged loss of learning time could negatively affect their children especially those who are writing Ordinary Level examinations this year. Dabengwa Secondary School is located in Ward 16, Nkosikazi Village while the affected learners reside in Ntobi Village in Ward 5, which is about 5km away.  The country has been receiving heavy rains for more than a week now and the Meteorological Services Department has warned of flooding in some areas A number of schools in Matabeleland North Province are recording low pass rates in public examinations due to a number of reasons which include lack of infrastructure, long distances travelled to schools and shortage of Information Communication Technology (ICT) gadgets. <img class="wp-image-682259 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-10-copy-3-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-10-copy-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-10-copy-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Flooded river Mr Busani Sibanda from Ntombi Village said the problem was not affecting pupils alone as people from the village miss out on critical services when the river is flooded. “This is always the problem during the rainy season and our children have not been attending classes for three weeks as they cannit cross the flooded river. We don’t have an alternative school in the area,” he said. Mr Sibanda said what worsens the situation is that the river has crocodiles and no one can risk crossing it when it is flooded.
“What’s needed is a high level bridge which enables people to cross even when the river is flooded,” he said.
Mr Sibanda said people cannot seek health services at Balanda Clinic, obtain National Registration documents, seek Veterinary services and access police at Sigada Centre. “Imagine if these rains continue for a longer period and we have an emergency in the area, it will be a disaster.We appealing to authorities to urgently construct a high level bridge,” said Mr Sibanda. He said a handful of parents with relatives across the river have made arrangements for accommodation for their children so that they do not miss classes. Mrs Senzeni Ndlovu said Form Four pupils might not be able to recover the lost learning time.
She said pregnant women and mothers with children due for immunisation were also affected by the flooded river. “It’s a concern to us as parents when our children can’t go to school. We pay fees for them to attend classes but due to the flooding, they can’t risk being swept away. Those who want to visit clinics for services like immunisation, prenatal care and ART (Antiretroviral treatment) are also affected,”said Mrs Ndlovu. The local councillor, Sibongiwe Khumalo, confirmed that pupils were not attending school due to the flooded river.
She said they are looking for donors to assist in the construction of the bridge and a secondary school in the area. “We’re working on pooling resources together and also engaging donors to assist. We also want a secondary school in Ntobi Ward 5,” said Cllr Khumalo. An education campaigner who runs a Non-Governmental Organisation focusing on education in some districts of Matabeleland, Mr Collins Nyabadza said the situation needs to be addressed urgently. Mr Nyabadza is the chief executive officer for Children’s Voice Charitable Trust, which operates in Bubi, Tsholotsho and Umzingwane districts. “A month of lost learning time is just too long especially for those writing public exams this year.
“We fear that some children may be tempted to cross the flooded river,” he said. Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education spokesperson Mr Taungana Ndoro said learners must never attempt to cross flooded rivers.–@themkhust
