The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIFA Southern Region have set their budget for the year 2023 at US$40 610 which will be financed by affiliation fees although two sponsors, one from Bulawayo and another from Harare have shown interest in bankrolling the league.
The budget was presented before clubs by the region’s board member finance Tizirayi Luphahla at an extraordinary general meeting held on Sunday. <img class="wp-image-653845 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/gfvbc.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/gfvbc.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/gfvbc-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tizirayi Luphahla “Our targeted income for 2023 is US$40 610. The budget will be financed by affiliation fees. Teams are expected to pay US$1 500 in hard currency alternatively they can pay US$2 500 at the prevailing bank rate at the time of paying. The executive has extended a discount on those with outstanding affiliation fees. A 25 percent discount will be given to those who settle their outstanding balance in US$,” Luphahla said.  The agreement from the meeting was that new teams that have been incorporated into the Southern Region Division One league which are Bulawayo based Adachi FC and Jordan FC from Filabusi will have to pay their affiliation fees in full to avoid a situation similar to last year when teams like Indosakusa pulled out of the league while still in arrears. At the meeting, clubs also showed interest in the proposed national league. Regions, through their chairpersons are against the introduction of the National League which they propose should come in 2024. <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay The National League was first mooted and adopted into the constitution in 2013 but successive administrations at the association have not been able to implement it.
But Zifa is adamant that the National League will go ahead despite not addressing concerns raised by the regions, crucially the issue of funding for such a taxing league. — @innocentskizoe
