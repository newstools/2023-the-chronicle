The court said that an audit was conducted which led to the discovery of the anomaly. “Sometime in January 2023, fuel records were audited, and it was discovered that the accused persons had falsified information on the monthly fuel expenditure returns,” said Ms Pomerai. The ZETDC Plumtree Deport draws fuel from the Bulawayo main depot in bulk. The quartet was supposed to give a report to the main depot on how the fuel was utilised.  “The accused persons, working with one Muteerwa who is the regional stores man at the ZETDC Bulawayo main depot connived and gave false information on how the fuel was used,” said Ms Pomerai In their defence, the four men said between June 26, 2021 and December 20 last year, the company vehicle fleet number 1 467 used 1 300 liters of petrol yet the vehicle uses diesel. <img class="alignnone wp-image-583172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “From September 2, 2022 to 2 January 2023, the vehicles fleet number 4114 and 4160 used 1 680 litres of fuel yet the vehicles had been decommissioned during that period,” said.
