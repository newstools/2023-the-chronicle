The road was slippery as it was raining. Police spokesperson for Matabeleland North Inspector Glory Banda confirmed the accident. “The first party, Tobias Ncube was driving a South Africa registered Land Rover Freelander along Gwayi Mine-Mabale Road with 15 passengers on board. “Two were adults and the rest were juveniles all from the same family.  “He had been sent to buy sugar and decided to take the car and loaded the family members. On approaching the 4km peg, he hit a pothole and lost control of the vehicle which hit a tree and overturned landing on its roof,” said Insp Banda. He said all passengers were thrown out of the vehicle and one child died on the spot while another died on admission to hospital. The other 13 including the driver were injured. Those who were critically injured were rushed to St Patrick’s Hospital in Hwange, while others were taken to Lupote Clinic where they were treated and discharged. Councillor for Hwange Rural District Council ward 17 Joseph Bonda rushed to the scene soon after the accident and carried those who were critically injured to St Patrick’s Hospital in Hwange. Zanu-PF District Secretary for Transport and Welfare Cde Sikhathele Moyo who lives in the area, and other villagers rushed to the hospital to assist the family with medical supplies. “It’s so sad because these are all members of the same family that have been thrown into serious need as they had no money and we had to run around to mobilise money for medicine. “We are looking for donations so they get treatment and so far we got drips for those in hospital,” she said.–@ncubeleon
