The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE hockey Under-21 men and women sides stepped up their preparations for the 2023 Junior Africa Cup that will be held in Egypt by hosting exhibition matches in Harare over the weekend which yielded good results. Both teams played one match and recorded a similar score of 2-0 victories against select sides at Saint John’s Educational Trust Astro Turf which showed the capabilities that both sides possess. The select teams they played against were mixtures of national and club players.  The men’s team head coach, Fidelis Majuba said their preparations are going well as they have been doing well technically and tactically throughout their preparations for the continental showdown. “We have got a strong squad and a good chance of doing well. Technically and tactically we have been doing very well,” said Majuba. He added that they are appealing to corporates to assist them as they are struggling to get funding to make sure that they get to participate in the tournament in the North African country. Women’s team head coach, Brad Heuer indicated that preparations have been going well for the team as they have been training three days a week since the start of January. They have fine tuning in the morning on Sundays and in the evening on Wednesdays and Fridays in a two-hour session. “The ladies have been playing really well, together they have been jelling well and just learning more about each other, how they play, and even what they like. The formation, the structure, and everything from all our sessions is looking really good which is promising,” said Heuer. <img class="alignnone wp-image-458137 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/hockey-aa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/hockey-aa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/hockey-aa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Playing both matches with the hope of trying to impress potential sponsors to come on board, the Hockey Association of Zimbabwe (HAZ) is therefore still appealing for sponsorship from both corporates and individuals as things are not looking good with the tournament drawing closer each day. “We have a little bit more time to try and find sponsorship but at the moment it is not looking great from the financial side but from the team side it is looking great,” said Heuer. HAZ also took to their social media pages to appeal for assistance for both their teams to go and represent the country. “We need your help! The Zimbabwe under-21 Ladies’ and Men’s teams need your help to go fly our flag high in Egypt 2023 at the Under 21 Junior Africa Cup. The teams comprise of 36 energetic spirited young men and women who need airfares, accommodation, food, kit, visas, and medical aid. Any form of assistance is greatly appreciated,’’ posted HAZ on their Facebook page. The Junior Africa Cup will serve as a direct qualifier for the 2023 Junior World Cup, with the winner and runner-up qualifying. Both teams are made up of 18 members after they were cut down from the 36 who made the provisional squad a couple of months back. -@brandon_malvin
