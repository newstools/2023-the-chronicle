For now, affected learners are using tents.” Mr Moyo said they also need resources to repair Kafusi Secondary and Sibona Primary. He said some families were also in need of assistance such as food. Mr Moyo said as the CPU committee they continue to urge villagers to ensure that their homes are stable to reduce chances of them being damaged by rains.

We have to utilise the locally available resources and see how far they can take us. We also have to mobilise resources to help the affected villagers. We shouldn’t sit back and expect to get assistance elsewhere. The help can come but after we have done our part. “The state of learning infrastructure is important as it can affect the performance of learners. We would like to appeal to various stakeholders and partners to come in and assist in rehabilitating old schools,” he said.
