The Chronicle Angela Sibanda, Showbiz Correspondent TWO young film producers from Pumula suburb have collaborated on a short film that they are hoping to premiere as a feature film for local television. Directed and produced by Blessings Ntambalika (23) and Prosper Maregere (22), the short film titled ‘Izitha’ is an action-packed project that takes after most South African and American action movies where the use of guns and car hijackings are the order of the day. The two young men are the lead actors in the film which was shot at Amhlophe High School, a local funeral parlour and the Pumula North suburb. Maregere said the film was shot with a budget of US$600 which they had been raising through a dance and performance group where they have been performing at public events and hosting shows at local schools. “We created an arts group in 2021 and we’ve been using it to raise funds for the film. We hired an independent cinematographer to shoot for us since we don’t have the equipment and skills to do so on our own. “We had a total of 24 actors for the current episode which contains 15 scenes and our wish is to get recognition from local television stations and will be honoured if anyone will be willing to take a bet on us,” Maregere said. The trailer for the film explores themes of gender-based violence, crime and the existence of notorious gangs. It is already available on YouTube on their channel ‘Izitha’. It is expected to make its grand premiere in April on a date that is yet to be announced.
