The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter ENTUMBANE suburb in Bulawayo is named after Entumbane Hill where King Mzilikazi’s bones lie, renowned historian, Pathisa Nyathi told Saturday Chronicle. The name is befitting as the suburb is home to some famous sons and daughters who have raised the city’s flag nationally, regionally and internationally. Some people might not know some of these Entumbane boys and girls. This is the suburb that gave us Achuzi, a kwaito band formed by Unity ‘‘Mauzah’’ Moyo in 1996. The group was an instant success in the city and later beyond the country’s borders. Emarabini, the country’s 2002 Zimbabwe Music Awards video of the year was ‘‘made’’ in Entumbane by its very own son — Jeys Marabini born Majahawodwa Ndlovu. <img class="wp-image-678476 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-9-copy-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-9-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-9-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jeys Marabini Other musicians from Entumbane are Ernest Masongela and the late gospel artiste Rivonia Khumalo.
