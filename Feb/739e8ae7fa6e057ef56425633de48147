The Chronicle   Tafadzwa Chibukwa, Online Reporter INORDER to triumph in the war against drugs and substance abuse, there is a need for the laws against drugs in the country to be made stricter. This was said by Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Drugs and Narcotics Southern Region Detective Constable, Doreen Mudzimu during a drug and substance abuse awareness campaign held on 25 February in Bulawayo. Residents from Hillside, Burnside, Famona and local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as Youth Network Connect, Pasipemumvuri and Arcadia C.H.I.L.D Trust, among others, attended the awareness campaign that was  held at the Zimbabwe Academy of Music. <img class="wp-image-685132 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-28-at-12.04.31-PM1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-28-at-12.04.31-PM1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-28-at-12.04.31-PM1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Attendants at the Dru and substance abuse awareness campaign at the Zimbabwe Academy of Music last Saturday Drugs and substance abuse has become a cause for concern in Bulawayo and the country as a whole, with police and the Government embarking on campaigns to arrest drug peddlers. President Mnangagwa has said the country will beef up security at ports of entry to ensure that drugs are not smuggled into the country. In a presentation during the awareness campaign, Detective Constable Mudzimu said there is a need for laws to be hard on drug peddlers. “The laws against drugs need to be made stricter so that they can address the challenge we are dealing with. The laws at hand are not deterrent enough. We find people still supplying drugs even after being arrested several times. This is because the amount of money they are making from selling drugs is greater than the money they lose when paying fines after being arrested. If the money they pay for fines was a lot you would find that most would desist from selling these illicit substances,” said Detective Const Mudzimu. She said police in Bulawayo have arrested 267 drug peddlers this month and they continue to make arrests. Clinical psychologist at Ingutsheni Central Hospital, Mr Tafara Manyuni concurred with Detective Const Mudzimu. He said there is a need to enact tough laws to deter drug pushers. “The fight against drug abuse is wrongly focused, we should not be focusing on the drug addicts but putting all our focus on the suppliers who are giving the addicts these drugs. Once we do that, we will be able to reign victorious in this war against drug and substance abuse. At most times these people are escaping easily, paying fines that do not mean anything to them hence there is a need to introduce strict ways of dealing with them,” said Mr Manyuni. A local pharmacist, Mr Clever Nyoka said the fight against drug abuse should also focus on how and why the drugs are now easily accessible. He said this has become a cause for concern which needs to be looked into and resolved. Speaking during the campaign, a recovering drug addict Mr Simon Wakefield said support from loved ones has been his pillar of strength. “As someone who has been in a dark space, consumed by drug addiction, I had turned into another character that I never appreciated myself. Drugs are a dangerous vice that might lead to a lot of consequences if not controlled. As a society we must be in a position to be our brother’s keepers, let us check up on each other and be able to help when one has fallen into the       trap of drug abuse,” said Mr Wakefield. Arcadia C.H.I.L.D Trust, Mr Rqbal Jassat said working with the youth made him advocate against the abuse of drugs and substances. “Having interacted with youths a lot both in Zimbabwe and South Africa I realised a huge problem that has taken over the lives of most of our youths. I decided that I would use all the power in me to be someone who educates them that drugs are not a solution to anything. As Arcadia C.H.I.L.D Trust we want to teach youths that drugs are not a cool thing, not only are we targeting the addicts but we are also targeting those that are taking drugs passively to stop before they get addicted,” he said. @Sagepapie14
