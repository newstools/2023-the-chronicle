MARONDERA’S Peterhouse will play host to the national athletics finals of the National Association for Secondary Heads (Nash) set for March 23. The athletics competitions return after a three-year sabbatical caused by Covid-19 which led to suspension of schools sport between 2020 and 2022. Arthur Maphosa, the Nash president said there is an aura of excitement among schools, with a majority having held their inter-house competitions.  Nash expects all district competitions to have been held by today to enable selection for the provincial championships which are tentatively set for March 3. “We’re on our first term sporting activities that comprise athletics and the game of chess. Zonal competitions have been done in most of our provinces throughout the country. We’re looking forward to district competitions wrapping up on Friday, February 17. <img class="wp-image-643653 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Nash-president-Arthur-Maphosa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Nash-president-Arthur-Maphosa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Nash-president-Arthur-Maphosa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nash president Arthur Maphosa “Our provincial competitions are earmarked for the week ending 3 March throughout the country.
