The Chronicle Tina Musonza, Harare Bureau The Government has embraced the just-ended National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) for setting a peaceful atmosphere for the nation through promoting and embracing arts after audiences from all parts of the world vicariously celebrated some of the superstar artistes who scooped the awards last Saturday. The award show, which was full of surprises, frustration and disappointments, saw local artistes such as dancers, poets, actors and writers, among others, showcasing their talent from fashion to performances, although this year many people on social media were criticising the awards for putting up a lukewarm show compared to last year’s edition. Speaking at the ceremony, Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Kirsty Coventry commended all artists for embracing their cultural norms and also showcasing talent in spheres of influence they are confined in.  “I really want to take recognition of the deliberate singers of the national anthem,” she said. “It made me so proud to be Zimbabwean. It made me proud to show our unity and diversity and it really makes me proud that we are telling our good stories. “That is the ministry’s push this year. We want Zimbabweans to tell our stories. We are wanting to unite the nation through our artists and arts and culture industries and our sports and we are wanting people to be proud, proud to be Zimbabwean. That made me so proud and really made me excited to be here with all of you “Thank you to our incredible artists that leave and breathe Zimbabwe. You speak it, you dream it, you then deliver on it whether it’s through theatre or music or art paintings of sculptures.” Minister Coventry said Zimbabwe was blessed with young talent. <img class="wp-image-684571 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Kirsty-Coventry-at-Nama.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Kirsty-Coventry-at-Nama.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Kirsty-Coventry-at-Nama-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Kirsty Coventry at Nama She commended Nama for being the branch of arts genres in supporting the artist deep-rooted talents that were drawn from the passion of refurbishing and revamping the Zimbabwean arts. She said arts were not made of entertainment, but also a way of escaping livelihood challenges, especially for the youths. “You have all given something to this country, to your sector that is allowing younger people to continue to dream and be inspired and push even higher so thank you so much and congratulations to all of you,” said Minister Coventry. “Winners, nominations, those that weren’t nominated, congratulations, you are delivering on pushing this cultural sector industry forward and making it a formal sector and that makes me happy then I can go to my partner ministries of finance and give them the return on investments and get more money so keep doing well. “Keep doing what we are doing and we will push for you in all platforms to showcase the talent that you have and to showcase the brilliance that Zimbabwe has and to tell our stories.” <img class="wp-image-684550 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Dorcas-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Dorcas-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Dorcas-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Outstanding Female Musician award winner Dorcas Moyo sheds tears of joy While the audience were raising suspense around artistes they are attached to, they shocked them after winners were transparently selected from the nominees list.
