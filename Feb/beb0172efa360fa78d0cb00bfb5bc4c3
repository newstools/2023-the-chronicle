The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter TUESDAY, 14 February, was Valentine’s Day, a day for lovers and we were privileged to witness a spectacle of lovebirds in acts of public affection. Quite a number of these lovers met through dating apps such as Tinder, Kippo, Bumble, Clover Dating and Hinge.
Saturday Leisure was surprised to learn that Zimbabweans make use of these dating websites and apps considering that interacting with strangers online can put one at risk of identity theft, online harassment, stalking, digital dating abuse, catfishing, and other scams. <img class="wp-image-485094 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/a-day-after-Valentine’s-Day.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/a-day-after-Valentine’s-Day.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/a-day-after-Valentine’s-Day-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Valentine’s Day Tadiwa Kasira said dating applications are credible sources of love.
“Is WhatsApp a dating application? If so, then yes. I met my last girlfriend on WhatsApp and it turned out to be the most solid and meaningful relationship I had in about two-three years. We fell for each other before we met and when we finally met, it was like we’d known each other for the longest time,” he said. For those who belong to Shytown, dating applications are surely the way to go as suggested by Given Shava.
“Sometimes, it’s not easy to approach the one you want face-to-face so these virtual applications act as a bridge to love. If you love someone, it’s not that easy to approach them, especially if you are not close. So, if I can’t approach her face-to-face, then dating applications help on that front because some of us are shy. I have tried these dating applications but I must admit, most of them ended up at the talking stages. Finding real love is gold nowadays,” said Shava.  Happiness Ndebele believes the use of dating sites is a sign of desperation and self-doubt.
“I would never go on Tinder for love. I think that would be desperation and self-doubt. Only desperate people go to dating sites for true love. How can you judge intentions and character over the phone? Most damning of all is that people create fake accounts with nefarious intentions. We have heard of people trafficked under the guise of love. This scares me the most because it’s not easy to vet virtually. So, to me, dating applications are just there for social interactions, not true love,” said Ndebele. For the old guard, conventional ways of courtships are tried and tested. A woman only identified as MaSibanda said virtual interactions don’t cut it for her.
“I think if someone approaches you virtually while he has a chance to talk to you physically that fellow will either be afraid and/or disrespectful. I understand the idea of the advancement of technology and communication systems but one must man-up and be brave enough to face a woman. Back in the day, no man would court or try to woo you over the phone because they knew that such an act was a non-starter. So for me, dating applications are not the way to go. I trust the conventional way of doing things because they are tried and tested,” she said. — @eMKlass_49
