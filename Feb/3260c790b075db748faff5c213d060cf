IN the midst of what some have decided to view as an identity crisis at Highlanders, the club’s executive will today hold ideology lessons with the players as they seek to ensure the players are in sync with the club’s way of doing things. The meeting happens to have come at the opportune time as a section of fans have suggested the club’s values and culture were being neglected by the club leadership and players. Bosso supporters feel that the current crop does not understand what it means to play for Amahlolanyama. Fans, however, may not need to worry much as the club leadership is set to educate players on the club’s tradition, values and culture, not as a counter to complaints on social media but something that was already in the pipeline.  “The ideological lessons will be done today by the executive. It’s the beginning of the season, and so it’s important to go through the club culture and our aim and goal of the season. “We also have new signings we want to teach them the team culture, what we stand for as Highlanders, and revive team spirit amongst other things,” said Bosso communications officer Nozibelo Maphosa. Bosso are in Beitbridge where they are having a week long pre-season camp which comes to an end on Friday. <img class="wp-image-614112 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso spokesperson Nozibelo Maphosa Part of the training camp are former Bulawayo City captain Melikhaya Ncube, who made his debut for Highlanders in a friendly match against Sheasham in Gweru on Saturday.
