He worked here at the Bulawayo Provincial Hero’s Acre as a curator,” he said.  Cde Molly Mpofu who was representing the ruling party, said President Mnangagwa also shared the grief with Cde Ncube’s family following his untimely death. She said people like Cde Ncube made sacrifices to liberate the country and continued to work for both the party and country after Independence. “This is the family of a person who made me a member of the Politburo and Central Committee and a war veteran because of his sacrifices. During the war, Cde Ncube, as a brother, said to me, you shouldn’t cross the Zambezi River because you are too young although we wanted to be part of the liberation struggle,” said Cde Mpofu. She said it really pains her when people demean war veterans. <img class="wp-image-679759 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/uyugffghgff.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/uyugffghgff.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/uyugffghgff-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A representative from the Joint Operations Command (Joc) pays homage to the Ncube family at the Byo Provincial Heroes Acre in Nkulumane yesterday “Our brothers and sisters died and some drowned trying to swim cross the Zambezi River.
