The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe Warriors fringe player, Last Jesi is on the verge of joining Bulawayo Chiefs FC who are on a rebuilding exercise under new coach Lizwe Sweswe. <img class="wp-image-466378 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Lizwe-Sweswe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Lizwe-Sweswe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Lizwe-Sweswe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lizwe Sweswe The former Manica Diamonds FC and FC Platinum midfield genius, who had a brief spell at Al Hilal FC of Sudan in 2020, seems to have impressed Sweswe. Jesi, who featured for Al Hilal in five Champions League matches and was named Man-of-the-Match twice, will be hoping to make an immediate impact at Bulawayo Chiefs just like he did when he arrived in Sudan. At Al Hilal, Jesi made an instant impact on arrival when he scored on his debut as the Omdurman-based side drew 1-1 against Hay-Al-Arab in a Premier League encounter. Upon termination of his contract with the Sudan side, Jesi came back to Zimbabwe and joined Ngezi Platinum Stars. Sweswe confirmed that the central midfielder is training with Amakhosi Amahle.  “Jesi has been training with us and could be our latest acquisition depending on what he agrees on with the club. We’re rebuilding and as such, we need stability,” said Sweswe. Jesi, if he signs will join former national team midfielder Danny “Deco” Phiri, forward Ayanda Ncube and seasoned utility player William Stima among Bulawayo Chiefs’ new signings. Bulawayo Chiefs lost the trio of Moyo twins Elvis and Kevin as well as Arthur “Diego” Musiyiwa to Dynamos, utility player Kelvin Madzongwe who found home at Caps United as well as forward Perfect Chikwende who rejoined FC Platinum. Attacking midfielder Hughe Chikosa has joined Simba Bhora, with goalkeepers David Bizabani and Matripples Muleya moving to Green Fuel and Triangle United respectively. <img class="wp-image-587612 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Kelvin-Madzongwe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Kelvin-Madzongwe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Kelvin-Madzongwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kelvin Madzongwe Skipper Malvin Mkolo, Mthokozisi Msebe and Obriel Chirinda are some of the key players that the financially troubled Amakhosi Amahle managed to retain. -@ZililoRu
