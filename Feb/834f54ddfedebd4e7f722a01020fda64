BULAWAYO Chiefs Football Club are in the hunt for goalkeepers after losing 22-year-old Matripples Muleya to fellow Premiership side Triangle United. The Makokoba-bred goalie had been expected to command the number one spot Chiefs who lost seasoned goal minder David Bizabani to topflight newbies Green Fuels FC. Muleya, an emerging goalkeeper, had been with Bulawayo Chiefs for at least four years and the club has indicated that it will be filing for the player’s development compensation.  Thulani “Javas” Sibanda, Bulawayo Chiefs’ spokesperson confirmed Muleya’s exit following the end of his contract and said they are looking at recruiting young goalkeepers with Premiership experience. Former Young Warriors goalkeeper Issah Ali (23) formerly with Ngezi Platinum Stars, ex-Bulawayo City’s Aaron “Arusha” Ngwenya (25), 20-year-old former TelOne FC’s William Muvuya as well as Justin Ncube who was at Bosso-90 have been training with Bulawayo Chiefs. The club is set to sign three goalkeepers for the 2023 season. “Unfortunately, we failed to agree terms for a new contract with Matripples Muleya and he has decided to advance his career at Triangle United. We wish him well and now we’re in the hunt for goalkeepers. We had good times with Muleya and as a club we take pride in that we played a big role in shaping his development, took care of his academic bills as we paid for his school fees. “As a club, we take pride in that the players we develop attract interests from teams who’ve been in the PSL before us. We will continue giving young players opportunities to play and if they move while they are under-23, the better for us as we will be able to claim the development fees which we will use to develop more youngsters,” said Sibanda. At Triangle United, Muleya links up with former Bulawayo Chiefs’ coach Thulani “Thuts” Sibanda, midfielder Lucky Ndlela and Ghanaian winger Wilson Mensah. <img class="wp-image-681832 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/kmuyjoli.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/kmuyjoli.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/kmuyjoli-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matripples Muleya Other players who left Bulawayo Chiefs ahead of the 2023 season’s start are the trio of Moyo twins Elvis and Kelvin as well as Arthur “Diego” Musiyiwa who joined Dynamos, utility player Kelvin Madzongwe who found home at Caps United as well as forward Perfect Chikwende who rejoined FC Platinum.
