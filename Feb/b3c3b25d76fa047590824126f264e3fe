The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi  Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland  South  Bureau  Chief WATER points in Matabeleland South province have become a hotspot for illegal mining activities, which are posing a huge threat to humans and animals that use the water. These illegal mining activities severely affect the environment as they lead to contamination of water bodies, siltation of rivers and dams, pollution of water as well as land and deforestation among other effects. Panning on river banks is highly risky as the soil is heavily saturated with water and becomes weak, causing it to collapse if tampered with. Recently, two illegal gold panners died while searching for gold near Dubane River in Gwanda. The two men who were in the company of two others who escaped unharmed, dug a shaft about four metres deep and continued digging towards the stream for about five metres in search of gold.  A wall which was separating them and the river gave in and water gushed in and flooded the shaft. The shaft caved in and trapped the two illegal gold panners in it. Despite the risk associated with their activities, the daring illegal gold panners continue to endanger their lives and those of others. Some of the gold panners operating in the province are conducting their illegal activities along Umzingwane River. In the Zindele community, Ward 22 in Gwanda District, the illegal gold panners continue to search for the precious mineral along Umzingwane River which cuts through the village. <img class="wp-image-645146 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Illegal-gold-panners-have-caused-a-lot-of-damage-to-the-environment.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Illegal-gold-panners-have-caused-a-lot-of-damage-to-the-environment.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Illegal-gold-panners-have-caused-a-lot-of-damage-to-the-environment-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Illegal gold panners have caused a lot of damage to the environment The illegal panners recently blasted a dam wall at Mashaba Dam along Umzingwane River in search of gold. The illegal mining activities along the river remain a concern for villagers as the river is a source of water for domestic purposes. One of the villagers, Mr Khumo Muhloni said the illegal mining activities were concerning as they threatened their source of livelihood. “Our dam wall was blasted and we suspect that it’s illegal gold panners operating in areas along the river. If the wall continues to give in, then we will lose the water in the dam. Our dam will not manage to hold water throughout the year as has always been the case. People from other villages bring their animals here when their own dams dry up. Many people will be affected if this dam dries up. “We suspect that the blasting is a strategy by the gold panners to get rid of the dam so that they can start panning. We hear that there’s a lot of gold in the dam and along the river and in order to reach it, the gold panners have to get rid of the water,” he said. Another villager, Mr Thompson Siziba said there was need for the illegal mining activities to be stopped before they cause further damage. He said he feared that the gold panners would blast along the dam wall again and cause more destruction. Mr Siziba added that the illegal gold panners were causing a lot of damage to the environment while also threatening the livelihoods of villagers who fetch water from the dam. He said livestock could also be affected by the harmful chemicals used by omakorokoza as they look for the precious metal. Zindele Village secretary, Mr Rabson Mdlongwa said the illegal gold panners continue to threaten livelihoods of the community. He said in 2019, the illegal gold panners invaded a sacred water point and the community faced drought for three years following the incident. “They came with pipes and machines and they drained water out into the bush. The place dried up and they started panning for gold. That water point didn’t hold water for two years and our area experienced drought. The village elders had to conduct a ritual to the ancestors; that was when things went back to normal,” said Mr Mdlongwa. He said there was need for the dam to be protected as it could sustain livelihood projects such as irrigation schemes, nutritional gardens and fisheries. Mr Mdlongwa said it was their desire to receive assistance in establishing an irrigation scheme. “The dam is a reliable water source which could also support a number of projects. We need assistance in establishing an irrigation scheme near the dam. The scheme would help many households,” he said. Mr Mdlongwa said the presence of illegal gold panners had resulted in other illegal activities such as stocktheft. Environmental Management Agency (EMA) Matabeleland South provincial manager, Mr Descent Ndlovu said illegal gold panners are after alluvial gold which is deposited at curved edges when a river changes its course. <img class="wp-image-626527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environmental Management Agency (EMA) He said their activities have a negative impact on the environment such as contamination of water bodies and siltation of dams. Mr Ndlovu said illegal gold panning activities also lead to land degradation and pollution of the environment. “We have a lot of alluvial gold in Umzingwane and Insiza districts and this is what the illegal gold panners will be after. Alluvial gold is an easy target for the panners because it doesn’t require blasting. It forms a belt within a certain level at the river bed. These illegal gold panners use chemicals and some use mercury which is dangerous to the people downstream. The water becomes silted and polluted. At the same time, these panners will be working in numbers and they don’t have ablution facilities,” he said. “This means human waste is deposited in the water which might result in a cholera outbreak. We also have issues of deforestation because these illegal gold panners cut down a lot of trees.” Mr Ndlovu said as an agency, they have alerted the police on some of these illegal gold mining activities. He said it is a challenge for them to engage these illegal gold panners and educate them on the effects of their activities as they flee when they see authorities. — @DubeMatutu
