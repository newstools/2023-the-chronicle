In an interview with Chronicle Showbiz, Babongile said the journey was tough but for a good cause. “It was an emotional journey for me because on one hand my body was very tired and on the other, I knew I had to fight on. I’m happy because of late it’s what everyone is talking about hence the goal of awareness was reached. “A lot of young people have come forward to tell their struggles of substance abuse and we are looking for ways of how we can help each other out,” said Babongile. Narrating the journey, Babongile said: “We (myself, Handy and Lewis Sibanda) left Plumtree on Friday at 7pm arriving in Bulawayo at 8pm. We ate some food from Chicken Inn and rested a bit. Just after 10pm we left Bulawayo, my brother and I did a light jog right up to West Acre and we got there at 12.21am and then a brisk walk up to Cyrene turn then another light jog up to the tollgate. “We had a light walk to Figtree shops then another light jog up to Usher Turn and that was at 4.26am. Handy was driving along us the whole way because we were advised that there are risks of robberies and wild animal attacks. He was carrying food and water and clothes as well. <img class="wp-image-678216 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dddseew.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dddseew.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dddseew-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Scenes during Babongile Sibanda’s 100km walk “From Usher, me and my brother walked to Sundowns (06:17am) where we changed clothes and that’s when my leg started giving me problems. From there we were too tired to jog thus we walked up to Marula and got there at 8:18am,” said Babongile.
He said his leg got serious and had to rest for a bit before he soldiered on in the fight against drug abuse. “We rested then slowly walked the rest of the way. We were joined by the Honourable Minister Ndlovu at the 23-kilometre point and he walked with us to Plumtree. We arrived in Plumtree at 5:05pm and we were received by many people including my mother and sister. We had the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and Social Services officials as well. We ended the walk at Omadu,” said Babongile. On having Minister Ndlovuand his family joining the walk, Babongile said it ignited his power. “It was a huge honour to have someone as high profile as the Minister joining us. I will never forget it. I was tired at that point but I got renewed strength when I saw him. He motivated me and encouraged me to press on at the same time showing concern for my leg. To me that is the true definition of a leader. “I was happy when my mother and sister came. To see people celebrating brought tears to my eyes. It made me happy that they saw what I was trying to achieve and support it. I was overwhelmed with the support from the community. Even up to today many people still stop me on the road and congratulate me on this achievement,” said Babongile.  Handy said the objective is to raise awareness of drug abuse and be able to create meaningful conversations to curb such. “There is an emerging problem of young kids, with some in primary schools, being addicted to hard drugs. Plumtree never used to have such a problem but of late there are many cases of children stealing and selling items from home, an upsurge in crime which can all be traced to an increase in hard drug users. “We came up with the walk one day while driving to Bulawayo as a team. We had different ideas but managed to converge and agree on the walk. Through the walk we intended to raise awareness about the problem and start conversations on the topic, put pressure on those selling the substances to stop, help encourage and inspire youth to abstain from drugs and help reduce crime,” said Handy. -@mthabisi_mthire
