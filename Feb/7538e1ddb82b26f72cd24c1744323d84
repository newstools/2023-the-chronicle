The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ANGOLA women’s basketball side proved to be physically and technically stronger than Zimbabwe when they powered to a 105-41 victory in the second round of matches of the International Basketball Federation (Fiba) women’s Afro-basket qualifiers played at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre Hall 4 yesterday. From the start, the hosts could not match the Angolans’ physical stature and at the end of the first quarter Zimbabwe were trailing 18 -36. Angola continued their dominance in the second quarter and were leading 55-23 at the half time break. Team Zimbabwe coach Tendai Chitauro admitted height was their opponents’ major strength. “They are very tall. You cannot coach height. They were just playing the long ball and getting the rebounds in. They are also good at shooting and they utilised that very well. “As a country, l believe we need to do direct recruitment looking for kids who are tall because best teams have tall players,” said Chitauro.  Cristina Matiquite top scored for Angola with 18 points while Tadiwa Mabika had the top score for Zimbabwe with 19 points. In the other match of the day Mozambique got the better of Zambia 87-51. The women’s Afro-basket quadrennial finals whose ticket Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola are seeking will be played from July 28 and August 6 in Kigali, Rwanda. South Africa and Malawi pulled out of the tournament. Day one of action on Tuesday saw Zimbabwe beat Zambia 69-57 while Mozambique defeated Angola 74- 52. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe men’s side will be in action this evening when they face Zambia in a Fiba Afro-Can qualifier. Zimbabwe won their opening encounter of the tournament 71-57 against Mozambique. — @innocentskizoe
