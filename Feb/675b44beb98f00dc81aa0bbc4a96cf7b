The Chronicle   Maita Zizhou and Lizzy Nekhoma, Online Reporters WHERE there is happiness, “it is bound to end in, tears.” Valentine’s Week with all the pulsating romance ended on 14 February. On 13 February we wrote a piece about how Valentine’s Day is a culmination of six days of loving bliss starting 7 February and ending on 14 February. What happens after the magic? When the roses have withered, the chocolates melted and the whole excitement of valentine’s week is over.  There comes the time for unresolved issues. Enter the Anti-Valentine Week that no one has probably ever told you about. It starts on 15 February dubbed “Slap Day” and ends with Breakup Day on 21 February. The week is all about cleansing yourself from bad love memories and re-discovering oneself through self-love to start a fresh love journey or revive an existing flame. Slap Day February 15: On this day people are allowed to slap their exes who cheated on them or broke their hearts. People may also slap away negativity as it’s actually a day to forget about your exes and move on with life. <img class="wp-image-681744 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-3-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-3-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-3-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> (source-Jagran English) Kick Day February 16: We all have gifts and beautiful memories from our Exes.
