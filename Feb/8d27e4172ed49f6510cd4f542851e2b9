The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN International Knox Mutizwa was recently honoured by South Africa’s DStv Premiership side Lamontville Golden Arrows for being the club’s all-time leading goal scorer with 51 goals. Mutizwa surpassed Mabhudi Khenyeza’s previous record of 39 goals.
He was on target for Abafana Bes’thende when they lost 2-1 to Royal AM in a league match played at the Princess Magogo Stadium. Mutizwa was presented with an accolade for being the club’s all time leading goal scorer.  Khenyeza became a club legend during his five seasons at the KwaZulu-Natal based club between 2002 and 2007 featuring in 102 official matches scoring 38 league goals and a total of 43 goals in all competitions.
Khenyeza, who had a nomadic career after leaving Arrows in 2007 returned to the club in 2015 to 2018 season, but only featured five times and scored a goal in the process to bring his total to 39 league goals. Mutizwa (29) is regarded as one of the most prolific strikers in the DStv Premier League. He is not just entertaining to watch but also a perfect combination of skills, power, intelligence and pace. He is also endowed with good ball control, visionary play and ability to score crucial goals. <img class="wp-image-638413 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-28-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-28-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-28-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Courtesy of his latest achievement, Mutizwa who in 2015 was named Zimbabwe’s Golden Boot winner Castle Lager Premiership after finding the back of the net 14 times from 17 starts when he was playing for Highlanders, has an impressive strike rate of 2,6 goals per match.
