The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter MANDLA “Lulu’ Mpofu’s youthful Botswana outfit Masitaoka moved a place up the table to fifth position in the Premiership after clobbering visiting relegation threatened Police XI 3-0 at Molepolole Sports Complex on Sunday.
The victory took Masitaoka’s point tally to 25 after 14 games. Mpofu, who joined the Masitaoka at the beginning of the 2022/23 season has managed eight wins, a draw and five defeats heading to the final weekend of the first half of the season.
In an interview from his Gaborone base yesterday, the former Highlanders gaffer remained modest about his record, adding that the club owners keep on putting emphasis on sticking to their goal of giving youngsters game time. <img class="wp-image-676936 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/klopb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/klopb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/klopb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cleopas Dube in Sua Flamingoes colours “We’re work in progress with our squad made up of an average age of 22 years. Against Police XI we finished the game with all the players on the field being under 23 years. When I came here, the club told me that we should survive relegation playing with young players and that is why you see that we’ve got less than six players who are above 23 years old.
“So, as we head to the halfway mark, everyone has seen how relatively well we’ve performed. We’re not carried away as we continue working hard and fighting relegation from the top. Hopefully, by the end of the season, some of our players will draw interest from bigger teams and Masitaoka will make money selling them,” said Mpofu.
Masitaoka are 14 points above relegation zone and trail leaders, defending champions Gaborone United who beat Security Systems 3-0 on Sunday by 11 points. While Mpofu celebrated his victory, former Highlanders forward Rodi Sibanda made his debut in Botswana as he came in in the 46th minute replacing ex-Tsholotsho FC and TelOne forward Mcebisi Moyo in Sua Flamingoes’ 0-0 draw away at Extension Gunners.  Besides being home to Moyo and Sibanda, the other Zimbabwean players at Sua Flamingoes are Dominic Chungwa, Cleopas Dube and Tendai Nyamusi. Chungwa replaced Dube in the 80th minute on Sunday with Nyamusi playing the entire game as Sua Flamingoes extended their unbeaten run to four games. Sua Flamingoes are on position eight with 15 points.
On Saturday, ex-Highlanders midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku made his Botswana Premiership debut coming in the 70th minute for Jwaneng Galaxy who beat Rahman Gumbo’s Morupule Wanderers 3-1.
Jwaneng Galaxy are in title contention, being second on the table with 34 points, two behind leaders Gaborone United. <img class="wp-image-678744 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/werj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/werj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/werj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nqobizitha Masuku Former Highlanders winger Daniel Msendami, who is enjoying his Botswana spell provided the assist for Jwaneng Galaxy’s second goal scored by Wendall Rudath.
