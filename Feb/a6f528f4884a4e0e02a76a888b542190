Four men Wellington Tshuma, Mengezi Moyo and the two deceased were working in a shaft on Friday night and they slept in the shaft. “In the early hours of the morning they woke up to find the shaft flooded. Tshuma and Moyo managed to escape before the mine shaft collpased trapping the deceased. One body has been retrieved while the other one is still trapped underground,” she said.

“These illegal gold panners were digging in an unregistered area near a river. It had just rained and due to the proximity to the river, the pillar between their pits and the water was very weak and the water gushed through the bottom of the shaft and quickly filled the shaft. “The two who survived were actually flushed out by the water.
“We assessed the incident site and established that it will be impossible to retrieve the body manually. The first body was retrieved by the gold panners manually but it was very risky as they were digging towards the stream where the ground is unstable.
“We are trying to get an excavator from one of the local miners to retrieve the body. It might take us long because the excavator will have to navigate its way through a narrow path but we hope to have completed this work as soon as possible,” he said.
