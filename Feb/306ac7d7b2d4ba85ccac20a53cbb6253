The Chronicle   Mehluli Sibanda, Sports Editor IN the absence of captain Sean Williams who is nursing a broken finger, fellow left handed batsman Craig Ervine will lead Zimbabwe in the two-match Test cricket series against West Indies which gets underway at Queens Sports Club on Saturday. Ervine is already the country’s white-ball captain and has been tasked with leadership roles for the Test series. Former England batsman Gary Ballance has been named in Zimbabwe’s squad for the two-match Test series against the West Indies. The left-handed batter recently committed to playing for his country of birth after he had previously featured in 23 Tests for England, scoring 1 498 runs with four centuries and seven fifties at an average of 37.45. The home side will also be without all-rounders Sikandar Raza and Ryan Burl who are fulfilling franchise commitments abroad, while pace bowlers Tendai Chatara and Blessing Muzarabani are recovering from thigh injuries. <img class="wp-image-677777 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gary Ballance padding up at training Seven uncapped players have been chosen in Zimbabwe’s Test squad, these being wicketkeeper/batsmen Tafadzwa Tsiga, Joylord Gumbie, opening batters Kudzai Maunze, Innocent Kaia, Tanunurwa Makoni, the pace bowling duo of Bradley Evans and Tanaka Chivanga.
