The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter ZIMBABWE has been placed on the global map after the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) appointed veteran broadcaster Mr John Masuku the co-ordinator for this year’s World Radio Day commemorations. <img class="wp-image-629434 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-27-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> UNESCO The global commemorations are running under the Radio for Peace and Mr Masuku is at the helm of coordinating the programming for the event across 195 countries. Mr Masuku is a revered broadcaster with almost 50 years’ experience in the sector having worked for both public, private and international media houses. The United Nations proclaimed February 13 as the World Radio Day in recognition of the importance of radio as a developmental tool. This year’s theme underscores radio’s importance as a pillar for conflict prevention and peace-building. In an interview ahead of today’s World Radio Day commemorations, Mr Masuku said he was humbled to have received a position that puts Zimbabwe on the international map. “It’s an honour as far as I’m concerned because I’m organising for all the member states of the United Nations and they are 195 and we are talking about all the radio stations in those countries. They are a few countries that are not a member of the UN. So, when you are talking about World Radio Day, of course I have my supervisors in Unesco and the Unesco director general is accountable at the end but I’m the point person and I come from Zimbabwe. So that gives me pride and I have to represent my country well,” said Mr Masuku. He said he was thankful for the support that the country has given him in leading the global campaign for radio.  Mr Masuku said the Government facilitated that he obtains visas on short notice. “I’m receiving that great support, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services were there to facilitate that I get my visa very quickly so that I go for my induction which I did in November and December,” said Mr Masuku. “I’m still overwhelmed with that and to cap it all in my 50 years of broadcasting and for me in this point in time where I’m in charge of a radio event, or radio occasion for all the countries of the world is quite a big honour. So, this is a pride for Zimbabwe and myself.” He said the Government’s programme to license community radio stations was in sync with Unesco’s community empowerment programme. Mr Masuku said the community radio initiative started off as an experimental programme in Kenya but has since expanded over the years in most developing countries. He said there is a need to use radio to foster peace and development. “We can use the radio for peace. This means we can use radio to solve any conflict that happens between states, between companies and families and in society. As you can see there are so many things that are brought to radio stations for solutions. The Tilda Moyo show (on Star FM) and others are solving so many societal problems,” he said. Mr Masuku said through radio, the country can tackle some societal ills including the issue of drug abuse. “Today we are talking about drug abuse which is bringing a lot of unhappiness and we want to use radio to ensure that there is no drug abuse in homes. Through radio programming, news bulletins we want to make sure that we resolve that conflict of having youths taking drugs,” said Mr Masuku. — @nqotshili
