The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Reporter LIVESTOCK farmers in Insiza District say the rampant illegal movement of livestock infested with ticks is to blame for the spread of the dreaded theileriosis, better known as the January disease, which has crippled many farmers. Recently, several smallholder farmers lost scores of cattle due to the January disease outbreak, prompting the Government through the Veterinary Services Department to scale up stakeholder awareness campaigns. Small-scale farmers and villagers from PBS Village, Ward 18 in Fort Rixon in Matabeleland South Province are among the worst affected after losing hundreds of cattle to theileriosis. Experts say theileriosis is a tick-borne disease caused by a blood protozoan parasite, theileria. <img class="wp-image-629308 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-5-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-5-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-5-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Theileriosis which is a tick-borne disease caused by a blood protozoan parasite, theileria The disease is manifested by high fever, enlarged lymph nodes, severe anaemia and death in some infected animals. The theileria parasite infects both red and white blood cells of cattle. It reduces oxygen supply in sick cows, causing anaemia and weakness. Mr Bangani Masango, Ward 2, Village 13 Headman under Chief Jahana said that villagers were frightened by the outbreak of theileriosis in nearby villages. He said working in close collaboration with veterinary officers, they have put measures to curb the spread of the disease.  “We are determined to ensure that every week, each homestead dips its cattle. The local veterinary department has assured us that there are enough dipping chemicals,” said Headman Masango. However, he blamed the rampant illegal movement of cattle to the ward by local plot holders. “When we heard of scores of cattle succumbing to the diseases, we got scared as a community. We then realised that the root cause of the spread of the diseases is largely due to the illegal movement of cattle from other regions to our ward mostly at night,” he said. “Local plot holders are transporting livestock during the night and we suspected that would not be properly cleared or vaccinated. Several truckloads of cattle periodically come here. We have engaged the Veterinary Services Department and they tried to burn some infected livestock. “However, the trend of illegal movement is continuing, added another traditional leader, Headman Richard Ncube of Vukani Village, Ward 20 under Chief Jahana. He implored the Veterinary Department to strengthen surveillance mechanisms. “Our thinking as a community is that if the Zimbabwe Republic Police and the Veterinary Department could strengthen roadblocks and surveillance, which could reduce or eradicate illegal movement of livestock,” he said. <img class="wp-image-644155 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/download-5-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/download-5-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/download-5-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Department of Veterinary Services The January disease is responsible for huge economic losses in cattle assets and farm savings in Zimbabwe as it accounts for an estimated more than 60 percent of cattle deaths in the country. The Government has urged farmers to intensify dipping and application of tick grease to their livestock as a prevention measure. — Follow on Twitter @nqobilebhebhe
