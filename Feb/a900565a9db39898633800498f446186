My contract at ZPC Kariba was not renewed. I have played Division One football before and I’m greatly looking forward to helping ZPC Munyati earn Premier Soccer League promotion. The other reason that compelled me to join ZPC Munyati is that it is based in Kwekwe, a town that is close to my home area Binga,” said Sianchali.
