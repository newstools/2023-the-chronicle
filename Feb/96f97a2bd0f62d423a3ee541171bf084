A teacher at the school, Mrs Stella Mtuke representing the headmaster Mr Donnington Munemo gave a moving eulogy of Hope, describing her as an angel who brought love and radiance to the school. “Hope was a flower plucked before its bloom in the eyes of men, but not in God’s eyes. The hopes and dreams we had for Hope and Nigel were of this world but God has destined them for much greater in heaven,” said Mrs Mtuke. Cllr Mguni said: “We, as a city are devastated at the loss to the Rusike and the Sibanda family in such a tragic manner. We mourn with both families as these two were very young, hope born in 2018 and Nigel in 1996. Very tragic. We stand with you Sibanda and Rusike families,” said Councillor Mguni. During body viewing both the Sibanda and Rusike families were inconsolable. <img class="wp-image-678196 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/lkkio.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/lkkio.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/lkkio-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rusike family members hold a body viewing for the late Nigel. The Sibanda family followed after the Rusike family to view the body of four year old Hope. The convoy to the cemetery was long and when it got there the two coffins were taken out of the hearses, with Hope being carried by her sisters who were dressed in matching outfits, and Nigel by his brothers and relatives, who also had matching outfits. The Roman Catholic church choir sang songs of comfort as the coffins were being lowered and then the pair was buried.
