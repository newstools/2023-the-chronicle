Social media platforms have been awash with disturbing news of a Harare woman whose love affairs were exposed, leading to her pornographic videos finding their way to social networking sites. The woman, popularly known as Mai Denzel, was allegedly involved in a love affair with one of her husband’s close friends. Things got sour when the friend discovered that Mai Denzel was dating yet another friend of her husband, leading to him leaking nude pictures and videos to Baba Denzel as evidence that she was cheating on the two of them.   This did not go down well with Baba Denzel who reportedly went on a rampage and splashed the nudes on social media platforms, probably as a way of embarrassing his wife and to prove that he was innocent in all this. Recorded phone calls by Baba Denzel also went viral as he sought to inform his wife’s relatives that his relationship with Mai Denzel had collapsed. Social media platforms went into overdrive and the pictures of Mai Denzel cuddling and enjoying quality time with her lovers went viral. The debacle sparked debate from various sections of society with some standing in Baba Denzel’s corner saying he proved to be a “gentleman” as he did not beat up the woman as many men do in such cases. <img class="wp-image-633181 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-28-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Infidelity- Image taken from Shutterstock Another section of society threw brickbats at the friends for betraying Baba Denzel and having affairs with his wife. The bigger issue which society should, however, be battling with is how this fracas might affect Denzel and many others in similar situations. Little is said about Denzel but given the age of his parents, one might assume he is of school going age, most likely he is in primary school. The child is a silent victim. Denzel represents a number of children who go through similar situations which affect them mentally and in some cases lead to teenage delinquency. The fiasco might affect the way a child grows up after seeing pictures of their naked mother flying all over social media platforms and stigmatisation from friends and relatives. Experts warn that such shenanigans by parents can negatively affect a child’s life. There are many cases of children abusing illicit drugs and substances as a way of trying to rid themselves of some demons caused by their parents. <img class="wp-image-593393 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ingutsheni-Hospital.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ingutsheni-Hospital.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Ingutsheni-Hospital-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ingutsheni Hospital In worst cases, some children have committed suicide. Ingutsheni Central Hospital Clinical Director, Dr Wellington Ranga said when children witness their  parents fighting often, chances were high that such children may indulge in drug and substance abuse. He said such children need a lot of counselling so that they avoid resorting to drug and substances abuse for comfort. “It takes a whole society to create a conducive environment for a child and it starts in the family,” said Dr Ranga. He said issues of mental health are serious but people usually look at them from the outside Dr Ranga said morality and integrity should be issues of concern to couples as it affects their children. “The video of a woman sleeping with different men should not have found its way to social media platforms. We do not want people, especially children, to be exposed to such,” he said. Development and Human Capital Practitioner, Ms Sinqobizitha Nyathi, said the simple fact that the two parents are referred to as “Mai and Baba Denzel” was unfortunate as it might lead to stigmatisation of Denzel. <img class="wp-image-613471 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/civil-marriagesqa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/civil-marriagesqa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/civil-marriagesqa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marriage “The boy might become a laughing stock to his friends and peers at school considering that his mother’s face was shown all over social media. The nasty separation of the parents does not only bring trauma to the children emotionally but financially, socially and mentally,” said Ms Nyathi. She said such children might become angry or resentful towards one or both parents. Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe General Secretary, Pastor Trever Masuku, said children affected by the bad morals of their parents need support from friends, community, school and the church.
