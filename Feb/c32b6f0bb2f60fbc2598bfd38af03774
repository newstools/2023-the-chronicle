The Chronicle   Slain South African rapper AKA’s posthumous album Mass Country has been released. The 14-track project is available for streaming and download across all major digital platforms, with Spotify releasing data that shows a major uptick in streams since the musician’s untimely death. The album comes out exactly two weeks after AKA was shot dead at a restaurant in the coastal town of Durban in the KwaZulu-Natal province. CCTV footage of the incident shows that the artist was assassinated for reasons still unknown. With a mix of local sounds, Mass Country features local artists including Emtee, Nasty C, Khuli Chana, Sjava, Musa Keys, Blxckie and Yanga Chief, as well as Gyakie (Ghana) and Kiddominant (Nigeria). “Kiernan was so proud of Mass Country,” AKA’s mom, Lynn Forbes, said. “As a family it was a pleasure to see his music’s evolution over the years. He played us this album over and over again. We’re happy the world finally gets to hear it.” Fellow SA rapper Cassper Nyovest wrote on social media: “Happy Mass Country Day. Big love to the Megacy.” Spotify sub-Saharan Africa’s lead for music strategy and operations, Warren Bokwe, said: “AKA was one of the few people who could be classified as a South African hip hop megastar and we are honoured to be able to continue to share his music with his fans both in South Africa and all over the world. “One of the ways that Spotify will do this is by featuring Mass Country on a billboard in New York’s Times Square. This billboard has also previously showcased other South African artists like Kabza de Small and Sha Sha, providing a platform to share homegrown talent with international audiences.” <img class="wp-image-684120 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/AKAs-Mass-Country-tracklist-Pic-from-@akaworldwide.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/AKAs-Mass-Country-tracklist-Pic-from-@akaworldwide.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/AKAs-Mass-Country-tracklist-Pic-from-@akaworldwide-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> AKA’s Mass Country tracklist (Pic from @akaworldwide) Data from Spotify shows that while South Africa represents the largest single market for AKA’s music at 38%, the vast majority of listeners (62%) come from elsewhere in the world.
