The Chronicle MAISHA Health Fund has urged Zimbabweans to take advantage of its low-cost medical insurance scheme, MaishaCare, and hedge against ill-health or sudden illness. The MAISHA Health Fund has urged Zimbabweans to come as many people in the country are struggling to have access to quality healthcare as healthcare costs continue to rise. Only less than 10 percent of Zimbabwe’s 16 million population reportedly has access to medical insurance. “Out of pocket health expenditure can place a huge financial burden on patients, and on their family and friends.  “Having an affordable medical cover therefore becomes essential for every individual, especially those that are gainfully employed,” said Maisha Health Fund. An EcoCash Holdings unit, Maisha Health Fund is a provider of tailor-made medical insurance services in Zimbabwe, offering medical cover to corporate and enterprise entities, colleges, schools and individuals. The Fund recently launched MaishaCare, which offers primary care from as little as US$5 per month, to make medical insurance affordable, accessible and convenient to a wide majority of people in the country, using their mobile phone. The innovative health cover grants low-income earners access to physical consultations, prescription drugs, online consultations through Dial-a-Doc, access to private emergency rooms, Government and mission hospitals. <img class="wp-image-640749 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-14-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-14-12.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-14-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> EcoCash MaishaCare monthly premiums are payable through the EcoCash USD wallet. Customers can also pay through a bank deposit or at the nearest Econet Shop. The service is also widely accepted at various council, government and mission hospitals, as well as at selected private health care service providers nationwide. In cases of medical emergencies, MARS Ambulances or affiliate ambulances will ferry the patient to the nearest health care centre. MaishaCare was developed with medium to low-income earners in mind. “As the cost of healthcare continues to rise, the right to health has started to elude some low-income groups of our population. This package was developed with them in mind because we believe in the right to health for all,” said Maisha Health. <img class="alignnone wp-image-448010 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Association-of-Healthcare-Funders-of-Zimbabwe-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Association-of-Healthcare-Funders-of-Zimbabwe-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Association-of-Healthcare-Funders-of-Zimbabwe-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> To subscribe and join MaishaCare, one simply needs to send the word YES to 0777222800, and a dedicated customer care staff will call them back.
