The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter FIRST Lady, Dr Auxillia Mnangagwa has donated fruit trees to Cameron Primary School in Mbembesi Village in Umguza District, Matabeleland North with school authorities immediately undertaking to start an income generating nutritional garden. The school’s nutrition garden will improve the diet for pupils and act as a source of income for the school as excess produce will be sold to the villagers. Cameron Primary School headmaster, Mr Victor Ndebele said they were grateful to the First Lady for the fruit trees, which he said will economically empower the school. “We feel greatly honoured as a school, on behalf of parents and indeed the local community, we want to thank the First Lady for this donation. This programme bring to life what we teach our learners on the importance of trees and their contribution to life,” said Mr Ndebele. He said the trees will also act as a windbreaker thereby protecting classrooms and other buildings against strong winds.
“What excites us is that these fruit trees are of nutritional value and to complement the First Lady’s efforts, we will plant more,” said Mr Ndebele. <img class="size-large wp-image-445754" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/First-Lady-Auxilia-Mnangagwa-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/First-Lady-Auxilia-Mnangagwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/First-Lady-Auxilia-Mnangagwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa Speaking during the function, Ward three councillor Veti Tshuma said the First Lady’s programme proves beyond doubt that she is a mother who is keen to uplift and support communities, especially those in the rural areas. “As leadership here in Umguza, we appreciate that umama does not forget us, it shows that she is leaving no one and no place behind and in the process helping us to build our own country as Zimbabweans, brick upon brick,” said Cllr Tshuma. A villager from Mantanjeni village Mrs Thandeka Mtshabi said they felt blessed as a community by the First Lady’s efforts to empower them and the environment. She said trees help protect the environment hence they appreciate the donation from the First Lady. A youth from Kuqala village Anantonio Tshuma said she was now empowered and knowledgeable about the importance of trees as a result of the First Lady’s programme.  “This programme is emphasising the need to jealously protect our natural resources such as trees.
“We are so thankful to umama for spearheading this programme. It is said trees are life and so she is bringing life to communities. We promise her that her efforts won’t go to waste as we will make sure that the trees we are planting are protected,” said Ms Tshuma. Bubi-Umguza legislator Elizabeth Masuku described the tree planting programme as an excellent initiative by the First Lady which further proves that women must take a leading role in the protection of the nation’s natural resources. “This is an excellent programme by our First Lady. It teaches us that it’s us, women who must take a leading role in protecting our natural resources such as trees not just for us but future generations as well” said Cde Masuku. A Form Six pupil at Sojini Secondary School, Ms Nompumelelo Ndlovu said her wish was for every Zimbabwean to support the First Lady’s efforts to turn the country green and help in the fight against climate change whose effects are already being felt across the globe. “The environment can only be protected by us and that can be done by supporting such efforts by our First Lady. As rural learners it’s a life experience to see such important programmes coming to us and we want to thank the First Lady for her efforts,” she said. The First Lady, who donated pawpaw, peach and guava fruit trees in her capacity as the Environment and Tourism patron, was represented by Matabeleland North Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Richard Moyo. <img class="size-large wp-image-678179" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sssssda-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sssssda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sssssda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Richard Moyo In her speech to thousands of people who gathered at Sojini High School grounds for the tree planting programme, the First Lady said in line with the philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind, she was geared to visit all provinces on a mission to promote tree planting. “We are all in agreement that trees and forests are important through products and services that we get for our livelihoods. Have you ever imagined what life would be like if we did not have any trees around? We would probably be in the middle of a desert. Desert life is characterised by extreme temperatures, dry conditions and soils being blown away by wind. Most of us would surely not like to live there if given an option,” said the First Lady. “If we want our country to be a place where we live comfortably without all the unbearable conditions of deserts, it requires me and you to put our heads together to plant, care and manage our trees and forests,” said the First Lady. She said in Mbembesi, which has a lot of shrubs, it is evident that there is a need to aggressively plant more trees to improve its vegetation from shrubs to higher canopy trees. “The trees we are planting today will play a dual role, beautifying the surrounding as well as curbing water runoff which ultimately mitigates against soil erosion. Trees also mitigate against climate change effects,” said Dr Mnangagwa. She said during drought periods induced by climate change, people in different parts of the country turn to natural resources for livelihoods. “Forests are full of resources like indigenous fruits, umviyo, umnyi, umtshwankela among other fruits. As a result of variety of species offered by nature, we are able to get all body-building vitamins and elements, especially for those still growing. This is a constant reminder of the importance of trees and forests in our lives. People from the rural areas collect the fruits and sell them in towns and generate some income to augment their household incomes as well as livelihood enhancement,” said the First Lady.
The tree planting programme is being held under the theme: ‘‘Trees and forests for ecosystem restoration and improved livelihoods.” Dr Mnangagwa said the theme emphasises the fact that trees and forests are important for the environment and people’s livelihoods. “Forests are habitat for wildlife as well as serving as a rich source of a wide range of indigenous medicines. Trees control runoff water thereby curbing soil erosion and stopping siltation that reduces water holding capacities of our water channels and reservoirs,” said the First Lady.
