PRESIDENT Mnangagwa arrived here yesterday for the 36th Ordinary Summit of the African Union, and immediately got down to business by joining other leaders to tackle the political situation on the continent, with specific focus on the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where a running conflict has displaced thousands of people. It was a hectic and packed programme for the President as he was part of a marathon meeting to explore ways to end ravaging conflict in the DRC. The meeting was held under the auspices of the AU Peace and Security Council Organ, which is chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.  Besides Heads of State and Government from Africa, the meeting was attended by United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and African Union (AU) Commission Chairperson Mr Moussa Faki Mahamat. In his report, President Ramaphosa said it was critical that the continent doubles its effort to combat conflict in Eastern DRC.
He called for parties to the conflict to abide by the peace framework signed in February 2013. “The aspiration of the framework was to usher in peace, security stability and development in the DRC and the Great Lakes as a whole. “Ten years since it was signed, DRC continues to experience periodic cycles of conflict and violence. We agree that the volatile situation in the DRC has gone far too long and is clearly untenable,” said President Ramaphosa.
He said it was unfortunate that there was continued incidents of people being killed and women’s rights being violated. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-682342" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-57-680x380.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-57.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-57-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The current cycle of violence is even more worrying that it is being fuelled by an armed group the M23 which was long thought to have been dismantled,” he said. The DRC has continued to be mired in intractable conflicts despite successive establishment of elected Governments.
It has been facing challenges in consolidating peace throughout its territory. The Eastern region has consistently experienced high insecurity and repeated incident of violence spawned by M23 rebels, an armed conflict in North Kivu Province. The group has seized swathes of territory in North Kivu province and neared the regional hub of Goma prompting hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. <img class="size-large wp-image-682302" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ghsfd-680x380.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ghsfd.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ghsfd-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa speaks to Vice President Chiwenga before departure.
