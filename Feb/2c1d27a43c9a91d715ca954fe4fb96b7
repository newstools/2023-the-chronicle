The Chronicle MOOVAH, Zimbabwe’s leading short-term insurance firm, has taken customer convenience to a whole new level by offering to deliver motor vehicle insurance discs to customers’ doorsteps. The move come at a time when motorists agonisingly wait in long queues at various institutions across the country when renewing their vehicle licences at the end of every quarter. However, this is set to end with Moovah’s innovative move, along with its platforms and insurance products, which give motorists time to focus on other productive matters. “Register your car anytime, anywhere from the comfort of your home or office and we will deliver the insurance discs right where you are,” Moovah said.  When customers buy motor insurance, Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara), and radio licenses on Moovah, they will enjoy the option of having discs delivered to their doorsteps. “After buying your insurance and you want the discs delivered to your premises, simply email the registration number and Zinara receipt number to EconetInsurance@ecocashholdings.co.zw,” said Moovah. “To renew your vehicle insurance, Zinara and ZBC licence discs on Moovah, simply Dial *901# on any Econet registered number, select Vehicle Registration, select Add Vehicle, and input Vehicle Registration Details,” Moovah added. In Zimbabwe, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance. The minimum requirement is third-party insurance, which allows third parties an avenue to claim compensation for any damage to property, physical harm as well as death, caused by the insured vehicle. <img class="wp-image-459945 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/zinara-office-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zinara In order to get a vehicle licence from Zinara, a vehicle owner needs to ensure the vehicle has a minimum of third-party insurance.
