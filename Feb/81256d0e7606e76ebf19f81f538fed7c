Meanwhile, organised hits and mass shootings are on the rise, according to police minister Bheki Cele. In an interview, criminologist at the University of Pretoria Prof Christiaan Bezuidenhout said the statistics were mind boggling. “We are turning into a murderous country. It has been known that we are a very violent country, but our quarterly statistics where firearms are concerned are mind boggling.”
