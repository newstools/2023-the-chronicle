The Chronicle Associated Press report that the death toll from Monday’s earthquakes in Turkey and Syria has now climbed to over 2,300 people. At least 1,498 people were killed across 10 provinces of Turkey, with another 7,600 injured, according to the country’s disaster management agency. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria rose to more than 430 people, with 1,280 injured, according to data from the health ministry. In the country’s north-west where the government is not in control, groups that operate there said the death toll was at least 380, with many hundreds injured. The number is expected to continue to rise rapidly, with many people believed to be trapped under rubble in collapsed buildings. -@The Guardian
