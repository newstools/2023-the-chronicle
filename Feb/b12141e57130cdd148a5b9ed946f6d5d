THE Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) has opened entries for the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) Inter-club Track and Field championships to be held at White City Stadium next month. The inter-club championships were introduced a few years back to strengthen the grass roots level of competition which is the backbone of the sport. Bab chairperson Watson Madenyika said they are looking forward to the successful hosting of the competition.  “The board is kindly inviting you to participate at the Naaz Inter-club Track and Field Championship to be held on the 4th of March 2023 at White City Stadium in Bulawayo. We are excited to be hosting this competition as our athletics season hits full gear. “This is only our third event of the season having hosted the provincial cross-country championships and the provincial track and field championships. From the two events it was evident our athletes are in shape and this should be a competitive meet. This is our first national event for the year and we are excited of the prospect,” said Madenyika. Entry fees are pegged at US$2/RTGS 2000 per event per athlete for cadets, youths and juniors, US$ $3/RTGS 3000 per event per athlete for seniors and US$4/RTGS 4000 per relay team. The programme will commence at 8:00am. <img class="wp-image-414972 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Athletics.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Athletics.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Athletics-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Athletics track Events on offer are 100m, 100m hurdles, 110m hurdles, 200m, 400m, 400m hurdles, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m, 4x100m relay, 4x400m relay, ZITF Coca-Cola Four Minute Mile Challenge qualifiers, long jump, triple jump, high jump, javelin, shot-put, discus throwing. <img class="wp-image-604248 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-26-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> White City Stadium Meanwhile, long distance runners Blessing Waison and Olivia Chitate have left the country for the World Cross Country Championships that will take place in Bathurst, Australia from February 17-19.
