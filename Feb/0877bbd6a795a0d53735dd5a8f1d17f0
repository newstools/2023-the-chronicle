“To be honest, gospel musicians don’t produce music to get awards but encourage, bring hope and share the word of God,” he said. Mlalazi said they spend a lot of time to produce just one song in order to ensure quality production.
He urged other musicians and artistes to continue working hard and avoid compromising on quality. — @themkhust
