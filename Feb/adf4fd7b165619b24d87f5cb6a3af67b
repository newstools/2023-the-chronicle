My parents and I relocated to England in 2002 and I grew up in Doncaster — a small city in South Yorkshire. It has been quite a ride for me here since I have been singing covers and acoustic versions of songs. I have also had the chance to perform with Uncle Simba, Sheffield Orchestra Music Hun, August Charles, Curtis Charles, and Medullaa. I feel nostalgic though sometimes, especially when I think of my grandmothers, whom I just saw recently when I went back home,” she said. Rumbi has been no overnight success in an industry flooded with talented musicians, she has had to dig deep. “I think the music industry doesn’t prepare one for the downs. It’s how you respond as an artiste that really defines one’s career. I have been blessed enough to witness some of the finer things the industry has to offer. These include the feeling of joy of the Library stage at tramlines last year, performing at two legendary venues in Sheffield, the Crucible and the Leadmill. What’s even better was that I was accompanied on stage by a full orchestra, big shout out to conductor, The Kids. “I had the pleasure of being invited to Abbey Road Studios, met Mahalia after doing my first festival performance, I was so nervous that day and I am doing my year tenure as a member of the arts council (ace membership). It’s been quite good,” she said. Rumbi’s discography also includes Refocused, Run Run, Take Care, and Don’t Bother Me. She has a 4-track EP titled, The Process which she recorded at her bedroom studio during the Covid-19-induced lockdown. The powerful singer is a big fan of the late Oliver Mtukudzi. <img class="wp-image-682548 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jhmghgh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jhmghgh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jhmghgh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rumbi, a singer-songwriter is an R&B/Soul artiste “Given a chance to spend an hour with an artiste, dead or alive, that would be Tuku. His pen was ever flowing! I would want to hear about his songwriting process.” Rumbi is relatively unknown in Zimbabwe and she hopes to change that soon. “It would be such dream to perform back in Zimbabwe, especially with my family. I had a really good chat with them last year when I came to Zimbabwe. Hopefully we can come to an agreement for something in 2023/2024. This year, I promise my fans a vinyl record, new merchandise, festival performances, a single later on in the year and more live performances,” she said. –@MbuleloMpofu
