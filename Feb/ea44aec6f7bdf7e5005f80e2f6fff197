A BULAWAYO entrepreneur who benefitted from a Government youth empowerment initiative 18 years ago, is basking in the glory of a successful business venture. After securing a loan facility, Mr Charles Vanderra (40) managed to build a business empire for himself and generated employment for the youth. He runs Vanderra Holdings whose flagship is construction and the company has been contracted to build schools and clinics in the Matabeleland region.  Mr Vanderra attributes his success to the youth empowerment loan that he received from Government in 2006. Government has in the past provided loans to empower youths, but due to previous loopholes in making them account to allocated funds, most youth squandered the money. However, as a way of preventing the abuse of loans, the Second Republic established the Youth Empowerment Bank which addressed the previous gaps. Mr Vanderra told Chronicle that while some youths were abusing the youth empowerment loans, he used the credit facility to establish a thriving business empire. Since his school days at Founders High School, Mr Vanderra believes he has been destined for greater heights.
After completing his Ordinary level, he became a family breadwinner by default following the death of his father. <img class="wp-image-679018 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/olnnbv.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/olnnbv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/olnnbv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> one of Venderra’s projects.

When I realised that my finances were improving, I started importing electrical goods,” said Mr Vanderra. “I would travel to Botswana to make my orders and even supply some institutions, but I was still very small in business.”
Mr Vanderra said in 2006 he decided to apply for the youth empowerment loan which ultimately became the bedrock of his business. The businessman said he saw a gap in terms of the procurement of spare parts for road rehabilitation equipment for rural district councils and applied for a loan. “I started supplying grader plates to most rural road authorities. During that time, I started Mountain Kings Company and my first capital towards that project came from the youth empowerment programme loan which I received from CABS,” said Mr Vanderra. <img class="alignnone wp-image-509783 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/CABS-Centre.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/CABS-Centre.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/CABS-Centre-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I was allocated US$2 500, which was deposited directly to a Harare-based company that provided the spares. They paid for 10 grader plates spare parts and I would supply to rural district councils,” he said. Mr Vanderra said thereafter he started procuring spares from South Africa then later in China. “It was that Government loan facility that changed my life. I was one of those youths who did squander the money. Yes, I had a bit of some money, but the US$2 500 that was processed through CABS really changed my life,” he said. Mr Vanderra said he later diversified and moved into the construction industry, and his company has been winning tenders in the construction of schools and clinics. <img class="alignnone wp-image-633580 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/moneyy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/moneyy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/moneyy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Presently, Vanderra Holdings is involved in the construction of classroom blocks at Cowdray Park Primary School, Joana Fuyana Primary School and several clinics in Matabeleland North and South provinces. Mr Vanderra said while his father was a soldier whose duty was to defend the country, he believes that he is also serving the country in his own special way. “As young people, we also need to serve the country faithfully and deliver the nation’s aspirations. I believe resources have been poured out for people to serve,” he said. “Sometimes, I think the people on the ground might be letting the Government down by failing to deliver on the projects that they have been mandated to do.” Mr Vanderra said one of the biggest challenges for startups is the need to formalise operations.
He said there are abundant opportunities that exist through the formalisation of business enterprises. “My biggest challenge was in formalising my business, especially when you are a young person, you just jump into business. However, when the business reaches a certain stage, there comes a time where you realise that you are not set to compete with established businesses as you will be operating illegally,” said Mr Vanderra. The father of four said he works closely with his wife Mrs Cynthia Vanderra in running their family business.Mrs Vanderra said being a couple working together is also cementing their relationship. “Working together is a powerful thing, we have been working together since we met. When he is not around I would be here to run other errands and I would be here to do exactly what he is doing,” said Mrs Vanderra. -@nqotshili
