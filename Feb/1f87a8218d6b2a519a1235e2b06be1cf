The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter The regions wrote to Zifa saying they want the National League introduction to be discussed at a congress where Zifa must avail all the necessary information which may include relegation and promotion so as to avoid chaos. The regions also want information on the National League funding among other issues.  After Friday’s board meeting, Zifa said they are going ahead with the second-tier, which is provided for in the Zifa constitution. The National League was first mooted and adopted in 2013 but successive administrations have not been able to implement it. “As per the resolutions of the Exco, the association will go ahead with the National League starting in 2023 season. The national first division league is going ahead as scheduled, starting this season. “We are conscious of the concerns of some of our members hence the Executive Committee will engage everyone and address the concerns. The interim Executive Committee of the National League will be made up of regional committee members. Each region will second two members to the interim committee,” said Zifa. The introduction of the National Division One League will see two clubs relegated from the Premier Soccer League at the end of the season instead of four. <img class="wp-image-616705 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-241.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-241.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-241-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gift Banda Meanwhile, Zifa acting president Gift Banda told our Harare Bureau that the association will uphold the timelines suggested by the Zifa Restructuring Committee in trying to come up with a roadmap that should take Zimbabwean football out of the woods and back on right track this year. Zifa members will meet later this month at an indaba meant to dissect the Zifa Restructuring Committee’s report.
Part of recommendations by the Zifa restructuring Committee are that the constitution should bar public office holders from running for Zifa office to avoid actual and perceived conflicts of interests, or politicising the association for personal glory. It also recommended the rationalisation of  powers of the Zifa president, the conferring of explicit authority on the General Secretary to manage the day-to-day affairs of Zifa. <img class="wp-image-546759 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fifa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fifa The committee said there should be a minimum qualification threshold for an executive committee member. The committee also recommended that the national teams should be housed in a structure that receives direct budgetary and administrative support from Government while ensuring that Fifa rules are respected in so far as the principle of non-interference is concerned. — @ZililoR
