SOCCER Star of the Year finalist Devine Mhindirira travelled with the rest of the Highlanders squad for their pre-season training camp which got underway in Beitbridge yesterday. The midfielder is only joining camp now having absented himself from the initial stages of pre-season which started on January 16. His actions left the club with no choice but to call him for a disciplinary hearing.
Bosso were reluctant to give details of the hearing outcome but said they had let him off the hook and allowed him to join the squad which is on pre-season training.  Inside sources however said Mhindirira was sanctioned for missing two weeks of training after he had asked to be away for one week to attend to some personal issues but ended up absenting himself for three weeks. Mhindirira, according to the well-placed sources, pleaded guilty to the charges. The midfielder last year extended his stay at Highlanders to June 2024 but was playing truant by not carrying out his assigned duties at the club.

It is understood the club’s supporters chapter in the border town are meeting some of the costs associated with the camp. “The team has arrived safely for the Beitbridge camp. The proposed camp days are Monday to Thursday. In terms of additions to the squad we have no update for now,” said Bosso communications officer Nozibelo Maphosa. <img class="wp-image-614112 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/nozzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso spokesperson Nozibelo Maphosa Bosso have so far signed striker Calvin Chigonero on loan from Talen Vision, recalled goalkeeper Reward Muza who  was with Bulawayo City, promoted Gillian Nyathi from Bosso90 and signed Bulawayo City captain Melikhaya Ncube.
