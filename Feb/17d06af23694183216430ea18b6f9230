The Chronicle Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter CHURCHES have heeded President Mnangagwa’s call for them to complement Government efforts in the fight against drug and substance abuse by introducing various programmes targeting youths. Zimbabwe is witnessing an upsurge in drug abuse cases and most of those abusing drugs are young people.
The illegal practice has been worsened by the fact that there are no rehabilitation centres in the country and addicts are likely to relapse even after treatment at Ingutsheni Central Hospital. <img class="size-large wp-image-652856" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/ingutsheni-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/ingutsheni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/ingutsheni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ingutsheni Hospital This comes at a time when Zimbabwe is working towards a drug-free society through a drug master plan which will help the country achieve Vision 2030. The master plan aims at dealing with drug and substance abuse in society.
In a speech read on his behalf by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube during the 62nd Guta Ra Mwari’s God’s Coming celebrations in Bulawayo recently, President Mnangagwa noted that drug and substance abuse has become a “cancer” that threatens the lives of youths.  He implored churches to complement Government efforts in fighting against drug and substance abuse among youths, saying the church is an important stratum in society. Last week on Tuesday, police launched a countrywide crackdown on drug peddlers and abusers as part of a national campaign to rid society of drugs. In separate interviews yesterday, church leaders expressed concern over the scourge.
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe (ELCZ) Western Diocese Bishop Michael Dube said as a church they have intensified anti-drug awareness programmes targeting youths. “In our church, pastors are on the ground preaching and spreading the anti-drug awareness gospel during one-on-one and group sessions and we are targeting our youths. We are also doing other projects with the youths such as clean-up campaigns where we go an extra mile of making them see the light as far as drug and substance abuse is concerned,” said Bishop Dube. He said drug abuse is a menace and urged community leaders to spearhead campaigns in their localities.
Bishop Dube said that the issue of drug and substance abuse should be widely condemned and spoken about in all spheres of society. “If the community at large, churches, police and the generality of citizens do not stand up to drug abuse, I am afraid as a nation our future is doomed because these young people are the future of our country,” he said. “Parents should also make time and converse with their children on this topic of drug abuse so that they get assisted in every possible way.” Bishop Dube said the main factor leading the youth to drugs is idleness. “As a church, some of our interventions include helping the youth come up with income generating projects so that they have productive things to do instead of just lying idle because an idle mind is the devil’s workshop,” he said.
Apostolic Christian Council of Zimbabwe (ACCZ) leader Bishop Johannes Ndanga said the church is in full support of the call by President Mnangagwa. <img class="size-large wp-image-677632" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa He said idleness is what causes the youth to abuse drugs and his church has introduced various programmes to curb such a menace. “We have a character education programme at our church for the youth where we engage the youths from various backgrounds and discuss such topical issues. Through those programmes, we are helping youths to stay away from drugs,” said Bishop Ndanga. “We want to have as many programmes and projects as possible for the youths in our church so that these young people stay focused and not succumb to idleness.” Bishop Ndanga said they have also incorporated the topic of drugs abuse in their main church services.
He urged parents to be responsible and not give up on their children in the event that they become drug addicts.
Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) executive director Reverend Useni Sibanda said the President’s call for churches to be roped in the fight against drugs is important. <img class="size-large wp-image-606643" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-15-3-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-15-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-15-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cakes laced with drugs – image taken from Shutterstock “Drug and substance abuse awareness in our church is done through the pulpit and outside the church set-up. We are in the process of partnering with organisations that offer skills training so that these youths are absorbed into these programmes where they are taught carpentry, farming, basketry, livestock keeping among others,” he said. Rev Sibanda said the church also uses social media platforms to send messages to young people regarding drugs and the dangers associated with abusing them. “There is a lot that young people can do in their communities instead of abusing drugs, which is destroying their lives,” he said.–@ReeSibanda.
