The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Reporter GOVERNMENT is seized with assessing performance contracts of local authorities’ top management signed last year before new contracts are issued and signed as part of the Second Republic’s policy thrust to ensure senior officials are accountable and perform to expectations. Ministers, permanent secretaries, and heads of local authority departments, State-owned enterprises and State universities signed their contracts, ensuring they are not only accountable to President Mnangagwa but to their mandate as well. The system is aimed at letting the public know exactly who exceeded their contractual expectations and who fell short as a means of ensuring Government targets are met. <img class="size-large wp-image-677632" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa The move to ensure senior officials sign performance contracts is guided by the nation’s economic blueprint, National Development Strategy 1 and the results will be made public, with clear indications of those who exceeded their targets and those who fell short. The officials will be evaluated on delivery, efficacy, management and implementation.
Some local authorities signed the contracts last year while others said they wanted to study the documents first, but the Government insists that all local authorities have to sign the contracts. The signing of the performance contracts which were meant for 2021 marked the start of a new system where those managing the public service were expected to perform to defined standards in line with key reforms in the public sector as the country moves towards an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.  In correspondence to all mayors, town clerks, council chairperson, chief executive officers and town secretaries dated February 2, Local Government and Public Works acting Permanent Secretary Mr Lameck Mudyiwa said the four day exercise which began on Friday in Harare and ended yesterday.. “You are cordially invited to attend in person the assessment of your annual performance against the set targets in your 2022 performance contracts signed in February and April of the same year. “As you are aware, 2022 Performance Contracts implementation came to an end on 31 December and as such the assessments are due before new contracts are signed,” reads part of the letter. “In view of the above, the assessments have been scheduled for 10-14 February 2023. The assessments are going to be carried out in Harare….” The letter stated that a validation workshop of all contracts was held in Mutare from 27 to 31 January where matters were raised with the planning processes and the subsequent planning documents. “It is against this background that the 2023 performance contracts will also be finalised in preparation for signing ceremony and you are encouraged to bring with you the person responsible for crafting of the contracts as the process will be done simultaneously,” read the letter. The performance based contracts are in line with the Government’s thrust of monitoring to ensure all its arms contribute towards the development of the nation. Government introduced performance-based contracts last year and all 21 permanent secretaries in line ministries were the first to sign the contracts. Ministers, chief directors, directors and other top officials including Vice-Chancellors of State universities also followed suit in the signing of the contracts, with President Mnangagwa insisting that results of the performance of public officials will be made public. <img class="size-large wp-image-674975" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-32-6-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-32-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-32-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister July Moyo Zimbabwean ambassadors signed performance contracts in November last year.
Public officials are expected to drive the country’s economic Vision 2030 of transforming the country into an upper middle income economy by 2030. In April last year, the Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Cde July Moyo, presided over the signing of the contracts for mayors and council chairpersons from most of the country’s councils, at the Large City Hall in Bulawayo. However, at the time, a few councils, including Bulawayo mayor, Councillor Solomon Mguni did not sign the contracts.
Cllr Mguni said councillors had to first convene a full council meeting to review the contract before giving the green light for him to append his signature on it. Other councils that did not sign at the time include Victoria Falls, Mutare, Chipinge, Chirundu, Ruwa, Karoi and Mvurwi.
