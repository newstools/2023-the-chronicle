The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Health Reporter THE inter-ministerial taskforce committee on drugs and substance abuse will be cascaded to provincial levels as part of the Government’s efforts to end the scourge which remains a great threat to the attainment of Vision 2030. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima said the committee will help the Government come up with effective strategies to end drug and substance abuse in Zimbabwe. He said the task force had already come up with measures that will help in tackling the challenge and urged citizens to play their part. The task force is chaired by the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and deputised by the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation. Prof Mavima said it is neither the job of the police nor the Government ministries concerned alone but everyone’s collective responsibility to fight drug and substance abuse.  “Research shows that a majority of inmates at our psychiatric institutions are drug and substance abuse addicts and it is time we all took measures and fight this scourge. Drug abuse is a great threat to our development as a country and eats a lot into the productive time of our youths who are heavily hooked,” he said. “I am happy Zimbabwe is geared up to fight drug abuse and we need to take responsibility, rise and ensure that our youth are active in ensuring we realize Vision 2030. The negative impact of drugs and substance abuse should motivate us all to be vigilant as we need our youths to be productive and healthy.” <img class="size-large wp-image-684309" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Illicit-drugs-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Illicit-drugs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Illicit-drugs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Illicit drugs Prof Mavima said the negative impact also includes stigma, gender-based violence and alarming levels of school dropouts.
He said Government is working on establishing separate rehabilitation centres for drug and substance abusers so that those affected have access to quality healthcare services. “Since the task force was set up we have managed to come up with different strategies and the committee which will be cascaded to the provincial level is guided by five pillars. These pillars include supply reduction, harm reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and community integration,” said Prof Mavima. “All activities are being implemented with the multi-sectoral approach so that we curb substance abuse. We have had 26 major campaigns against drug abuse nationally and we would like to commend Harare for going all out by setting up roadblocks to ending abuse.” The minister said for the scourge to end, there is a need for courts to pass harsh custodial sentences to those convicted of selling drugs. <img class="size-large wp-image-683412" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-11-10-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-11-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-11-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa addresses youths during the National Youth Day celebrations at Lupane State University (LSU) campus in Matabeleland North President Mnangagwa recently said Government will soon review the legal framework on dangerous drugs and illicit substances to come up with deterrent sentences for convicted persons who often prey on young people with dangerous and banned substances. It comes as police have launched a blitz on drug lords, peddlers and abusers in an operation code-named “No to dangerous drugs and illicit substances” that has seen scores of drug suppliers being arrested. Last week the country celebrated National Youth Day in Lupane, Matabeleland North Province, with a focus on tackling drug and substance abuse. <img class="size-large wp-image-683615" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-6-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Part of the crowd following proceedings at the National Youth day celebrations in Lupane, Matabeleland North Province The day was commemorated under the theme “Drug and substance abuse: A threat to Vision 2030, every community has a responsibility.” The illegal practice has been worsened by the fact that there are no rehabilitation centres in the country and addicts are likely to relapse even after treatment at Ingutsheni Central Hospital in Bulawayo. Government is setting up specialised medical facilities to provide services to drug addicts and survivors of substance abuse.
President Mnangagwa has since directed police and other security arms to act decisively in flushing out drug syndicates as well as dismantling the associated supply chains. — @thamamoe
