A TOTAL of 15 women under Young Women for Economic Development (YW4ED) in Bulawayo yesterday received 40 piglets. The women are part of the group which attended a pig-rearing course in Norton last year under the YW4ED programme.
The piggery pass-on programme, which is being implemented in Umguza District, meant to empower the women. First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa launched the YW4ED project in August last year and the organisation is open to all citizens regardless of their political affiliation. The programme targets women aged between 18 and 45 years.  Ms Sharon Nyauta, the Bulawayo YW4ED secretary general said they started with 37 pigs last year and the number has grown to over 200. She said they have managed to build six pig sties which are divided into sections for the pigs and piglets.
Ms Nyauta said they are still in the process of building maternity pigsties for the gilts and the piglets. She said maternity pigsties will ensure sows do not harm piglets. “Our pigs are strictly fed on recommended feed because this is a commercial venture,” said Ms Nyauta. She urged young women to venture into agribusiness. Ms Nyauta said the pigs are being passed on to beneficiaries and each group has 10 members comprising young mothers and school-leavers. <img class="wp-image-678643 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fgnbvb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fgnbvb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fgnbvb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Piggery Rearing at Imbizo “This is a look-and-learn type of thing because we want to show people that we are all about development,” said Ms Nyauta. She said the aim is to inspire young women to venture into agriculture which can be a thriving business. Ms Nyauta said the fully-funded piggery training programme had 30 women. Ms Diana Dube, the piggery farm manager said the project is doing very well. <img class="wp-image-678640 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/igggx.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/igggx.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/igggx-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Piggery Rearing at Imbizo She, however, said they are still trying to address some of the challenges such as acquiring enough space for the pigs, buying the feed and attending to some outbreaks of diseases. Ms Thandeka Sibanda, a beneficiary of the piggery pass-on programme, said the project is a great opportunity for young women to venture into piggery. “This is a good initiative, which is empowering women and uplifting communities,” she said. – @ReeSibanda
