The Chronicle Innocent Kurira,  Sports Reporter NATIONAL Association of Secondary Heads president, Arthur Maphosa has urged teachers to be extra cautious with learners as they take part in sport, which is making a return in schools after a two year Covid-19 forced break. The call comes after reports of a form three learner who collapsed and died during an athletics inter-house at Maranatha High School last week. Another pupil also breathed their last on the track at Khwalu Secondary School in Beitbridge in the same week. <img class="wp-image-678291 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/download.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/download.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/download-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Maranatha High School The first term of the public schools calendar is largely dedicated to athletics track and field competitions.
Maphosa said the tragedies have dampened the mood around the return of schools sport.
“We are happy to have resumed our games. It’s unfortunate that our return has been overshadowed by the incident at Maranatha High School,” said Maphosa. “We are at pains with the loss. We are sorry to the family and the school. We hope the death is not Covid-19 related. We are not at a stage where we can rule out the existence. The virus is not dead therefore all prevention protocols that have been put in place must be followed. “We encourage teachers to listen to learners when they speak on their medical conditions, if they have any. Parents should come forward as well and tell us if their kids have ailments so that we avoid incidents where learners partaking in events that do not go well with their medical conditions.”  Last week, a number of schools countrywide started holding inter-house competitions as the athletics season hits full gear.
Sporting activities constitute a bigger part of extracurricular activities that aid a learner’s aptitude. Schools’ sport also plays a huge role as a talent nurturing ground and feeder system for the country’s professional sporting disciplines. National schools’ competitions have over the years been a good ground for talent identification and some young athletes have ended up in professional ranks locally and abroad. However, most budding sportspersons’ dreams have been shattered by the pandemic in the past two-and-a-half years during which school sport was frozen.
National competitions such as the Copa Coca-Cola football tournament, Nash and National Association of Primary Heads athletics competitions have been a stepping stone for a number of successful sports persons in the country. — @innocentskizoe
