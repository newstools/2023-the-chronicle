Through the Youth Development and Empowerment Project, Mr Garaipasi offers travel and tours packages, exhibitions, workshops, modelling and tourism related programmes as a way of promoting domestic tourism in Zimbabwe. “I won the award based on my work to ensure youth development and empowerment in all aspects of life through the workshops I carry out with the young people. I offer them tips and guide them in all aspects of life by discussing various things such as drug and substance abuse, career guidance and relationships. I also encourage them to participate in domestic tourism and take care of the environment,” he said.  “I also hold modelling sessions with the youths where they contest and we have fun out of it because I believe modelling is part of tourism. As we tour, those are some of the things I take them through. It’s not all about viewing the environment,” said Mr Garaipasi.
He said he established the organisation in 2015 and has travelled with scores of youths to various destinations across the country. “We travel to places such as farms, villages, resorts, industries and explore different forms of tourism like historical tourism, sports, agro and industrial tourism. On Saturday I was at Terry Lion Park with youths and environmentalists who are into paper recycling and we enjoyed the day learning about the environment, recycling and drug abuse,” said Mr Garaipasi who also researches about the environment in order to gain more knowledge. Mr Garaipasi has won the Diamond Award in the Southern region Megafest Business Awards. <img class="wp-image-684901 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dfwerwer.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dfwerwer.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dfwerwer-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kudakwashe Garaipasi the national youth award winner in tourism and environment.
