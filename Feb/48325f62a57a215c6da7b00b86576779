The Chronicle Liverpool not for sell: Henry Liverpool owner John Henry says he is not selling the Premier League club, but does expect some investment. Henry’s Fenway Sports Group (FSG), which bought Liverpool in 2010, said in November it “would consider new shareholders” in the Reds. FSG chairman Tom Werner later said the club’s owners were “exploring a sale” but could continue their “stewardship for quite a while”. “Are we selling LFC? No,” Henry told the Boston Sports Journal.  “Are talking with investors about LFC? Yes. Will something happen there? I believe so, but it won’t be a sale.” The American was speaking in a question-and-answer session conducted over email. FSG has been open to investment in Liverpool for several years, and has recently engaged Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in that process. “I know there has been a lot of conversation and quotes about LFC, but I keep to the facts: we merely formalised an ongoing process,” said Henry. His comments were published prior to Liverpool facing Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at Anfield yesterday. The Reds go into the game eighth in the Premier League having won their past two matches. FSG bought Liverpool in a £300m deal following the controversial tenure of former owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett. – BBC Sport.
