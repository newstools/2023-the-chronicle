The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN striker Cleopas Dube rose from the bench to score a late equaliser that denied his former coach, Rahman Gumbo a first win since taking charge of Morupule Wanderers as Sua Flamingoes forced a 2-2 draw in a Botswana Premier League match played at Serowe Sports Complex on Sunday. Dube, who replaced Kalunga Sapalo at the start of second half struck in the 89th minute to give the Sowa Town-based Sua Flamingoes a valuable away point.
The draw saw Sua Flamingoes, previously coached by Gumbo whom they fired for a string of poor results last year, sliding a place down the table to position eight with 22 points from 17 games. <img class="wp-image-676936 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/klopb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/klopb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/klopb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Zimbabwean striker Cleopas Dube Sua Flamingoes, home to Zimbabwean quintet of Tendai Nyamusi, Dominic Chungwa, Mcebisi Moyo, Rodi Sibanda and Dube are now unbeaten in seven games.
Nyamusi, the club captain, Dube and Moyo were involved in Sunday’s encounter with Sibanda and Chungwa being unused substitutes. For Gumbo, the draw broke a four match losing streak.
Morupule Wanderers remained glued on position 12 with 16 points from 17 games. They are five points above relegation and the point against Sua Flamingoes could give hope to Gumbo’s side as they prepare for their next encounter against Nico United who are on position 11 and are two points above them.  While Gumbo is struggling to get a winning formula, Zimbabwean coach Taurai Mangwiro schemed Botswana Premier Soccer League champions’ first defeat of the season as his Orapa United clobbered title holders Gaborone United 4-2 on Saturday.
Playing away in Gaborone, Mangwiro’s side brought the champions’ 28-match unbeaten run in the league stretching to last season when they put up a top-notch performance to go level on 38 points with Gaborone United. The Botswana champions’ last league defeat was on February 19, 2022 when they went down 1-0 away at Township Rollers.
Before their defeat to Mangwiro’s side, Gaborone United had registered 11 wins and five draws in their 2022/23 season’s unbeaten run. <img class="size-large wp-image-660910" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-3-21-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-3-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/Untitled-3-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwean coach Taurai Mangwiro schemed Botswana Premier Soccer League champions For third on the table Orapa United who have registered 12 wins, two draws and three defeats, the victory meant that they are now unbeaten in nine games.
