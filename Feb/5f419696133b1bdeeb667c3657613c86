The Chronicle Sitting is a position of prosperity and kingship.
Standing is a position of poverty which talks of restlessness- instability.
Mark 11:12–20. The language of the fig tree spirit is that of barrenness and fruitlessness, it is a typology of poverty, a stubborn spirit because it tried to offer Jesus Christ leaves and withheld fruit, it made Nathaniel to despise the coming of Jesus and it made Adam make a fake covering. People can fly overseas and see what other nations are doing, but because they are under this power they don’t get challenged by the developments. Certain political leaders are under that power. It cripples your mind. You can live in one room for twenty years and yet feel normal.  The Law of the herdsman’s quarrels
Genesis 13:1-5 NKJV
Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, to the South. Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD. Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. Abraham had been instructed by God to leave his previous home and go to where God would show him. Abraham took Lot with him and as he prospered, Lot also prospered. Abraham was not only Lot’s Uncle, but he was also Lot’s spiritual father. Prior to that, Lot had nothing, he was just a poor man.
The blessing of wealth is a right for all children of God because it overflowed from our father Abraham. That is why you must never be apologetic for your financial altitude.
God Bless…
