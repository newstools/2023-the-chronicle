Some of the finest players from different provinces took part in the Saturday’s competition.  “Every province holds their own league so for us to see which one is the best team in the country we hold this tournament and the champions from different provinces meet and play against each other. “We are now saying after the Champion of Champions, our best team in Zimbabwe is Archers from Bulawayo,” said National Darts Association of Zimbabwe president Meynard Moyo. Archers were followed by Scorpions from Mashonaland East in second place while in third there were Rev Darts from Harare. Flight Masters from Midlands finished in fourth position, followed by another Midlands side, Mimosa.

I think it is because we are coming from Covid-19 and we are not yet organised properly. I am, however, happy because most provinces were represented at the championships,” said Moyo. <img class="wp-image-678605 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/egbf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/egbf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/egbf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Archers Darts Club The national darts championships which are usually hosted in different cities so as to promote and help the sport to grow, will return to Bulawayo in April and August. In April there will be the Easter championship while another event will take place in August. The final dates and venues for the two are yet to be confirmed.
