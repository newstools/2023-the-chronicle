The grounds experts have visited the National Sports Stadium which is home to Caps United, Dynamos, Yadah and Herentals. They were in Bulawayo where they inspected Barbourfields Stadium and Luveve Stadium, the facilities used by Highlanders, Chicken Inn and Bulawayo Chiefs. Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede, the association’s chief operations officer Xolisani Gwesela, the PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele and the league’s competitions manager Elisha Mandirevaare and the Caf trained ground inspectors toured the facilities. <img class="wp-image-608812 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-24-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede Zvishavane’s Mandava Stadium that houses champions FC Platinum as well as Ngezi Platinum Stars’ Baobab Stadium have minor issues to be attended to relating to the playing surface.  The team noted major concerns at the Colliery Stadium, Sakubva Stadium in Mutare, Rusape’s Vengere and ZPC Kariba’s home ground Nyamhunga. Manica Diamonds use Sakubva, with Black Rhinos and Cranborne Bullets playing their home games at Vengere. “Preliminary stadium inspections have been done and stadium owners were told the areas to attend ahead of the final inspection which will be done next week. At most of the facilities it was noted that the playing surface and dressing rooms needed to be worked on. “Urgent stadium renovations are needed for the Colliery Stadium, Nyamhunga, Sakubva and Vengere. A report will be sent to the First Instance Body, the licencing board after the final inspection,” reads a statement from the grounds experts. The FIB looks into the five facets of club licencing which include infrastructure where they rely on reports and even assess the grounds that the teams use. Also looked at by FIB is sporting that encompasses youth development programmes, financial stability of clubs, legal framework on club ownership and governance structure and administration which requires qualified personnel in administration or technical are employed. In the final round of inspections, Ascot Stadium of Gweru, the facility that newly promoted Sheasham FC might use in the opening stages of the championship if their Bata Grounds are not complete will come under spotlight as pictures of a waterlogged pitch were circulated on social media at the weekend. Sheasham are making major renovations at Bata Grounds. They are reportedly working on installing bucket seats in the VIP section as well as putting up a shade. Another Premiership debutant Simba Bhora are also working on giving their Shamva ground a facelift. Green Fuel FC of Chisumbanje are said to be upgrading their home ground. Rufaro Stadium, which was shut down in 2019 after being condemned for being unfit to host PSL matches due to an uneven turf, poor drainage and ablution facilities is reportedly being attended to and could be available by the time the season starts. – @ZililoR.
