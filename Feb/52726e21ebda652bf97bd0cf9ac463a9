NDS1 identifies ICTs as a key enabler of economic development and the entrenchment of ICTS across all national development strategies and as critical for the attainment of universal access by 2030. Information, Communication, Technology, Postal and Courier Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere and his deputy, Cde Dingumuzi Phuti yesterday commissioned computer laboratories at Tshazi Primary, Stanmore Primary, Garanyemba Secondary, Ntepe Secondary, Selonga Secondary, Buvuma High School, Mkhalipe Secondary, Nhwali High, St Joseph Secondary, Vhembe High School, Majini Primary and Siyoka Secondary School. Each school received 30 laptops.
57 laboratories have been commissioned under programme since the start of the year countrywide. <img class="wp-image-679970 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/aqfgfhnhj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/aqfgfhnhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/aqfgfhnhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Muswere commissions Garanyemba Secondary School computer laboratory Dr Muswere said the computer laboratories that have been commissioned will give learners the digital capability to research and develop the country. “The internet society will give students the capacity to understand and appreciate how best to exploit the environment and available resources. Learners will understand fully their various areas of study which are key to the development of the country,” said the minister. “We have been given an assignment by the President that we should not leave any place and anyone behind and this is the reason why we commissioned a total of 12 ICT laboratories in Matabeleland South province today. The President has given us another assignment to commission at least 50 more science labs in the province so we will be coming back next month to continue with the work.”  Dr Muswere said development of information communication technology has transformed lives of people in the country.
He said people were now doing thousands of business transactions online which is a great convenience. He said societies were slowly but surely being remodeled by technology. Dr Muswere said Government’s strategic thrust is to set up and make use of digital facilities and establish a digital economy. “We need to take cognisance of the fact that a large part of our population needs access to computers or else the digital divide will widen and leave them economically disadvantaged hence the clarion call by His Excellency, the President Cde ED Mnangagwa that no man and no place must be left behind,” he said. <img class="wp-image-679973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/afyhyjuu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/afyhyjuu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/afyhyjuu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ntephe High School computer laboratory Dr Muswere said Government remains resolute in its quest to attain a digital economy and a knowledge society where all citizens will have access to ICTs regardless of their geographical, social or economic status. He said Government will continue to provide an enabling environment for the growth of the ICT sector through deployment of critical infrastructure such as ICT laboratories in schools across the country. “It’s Government’s wish for all citizens of Zimbabwe to have access to the internet and digital connectivity including the rural and low income communities. I want to assure you ladies and gentlemen, that as Government we will never tire in our unrelenting efforts to ensure that our schools are equipped with requisite ICTs equipment and that our district Government offices have PFMS [Public Finance Management System] kiosks for ease of transacting Government business,” he said. <img class="wp-image-680024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/asdtgh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/asdtgh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/asdtgh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stanmore primary Speaking during the same event Potraz director general, Dr Gift Machengete said apart from the Computer Lab per School Program, Government has been rolling out a number of other ICT access and use projects to ensure that no one and no place is left behind in the digital highway. “Government is rolling out community information centres across the country where access to the internet and training in basic computer appreciation is free of charge. Government is also funding the relocation of co-located towers around the country to ensure unserved and underserved rural areas receive connectivity and participate fully in the digital economy in line with the requirements of NDS1,” he said. <img class="wp-image-680022 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/adgh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/adgh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/adgh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tshazi Secondary School Dr Machengete said the province also has 13 communication information centres. “Under computer distribution, six schools from Matabeleland South Province received 90 computers each under the Connect a School- Connect a Community Project to make a total of 540 computers.
