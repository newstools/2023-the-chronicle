(Picture: Memory Mangombe) More than 17 countries from the Paris Club of creditor nations attended the highly subscribed meeting, along with the World Bank, and European Investment Bank, to discuss the roadmap towards settling Zimbabwe’s debts. Despite being under illegal economic sanctions, Zimbabwe has shown its commitment to clear existing debts, which continue to weigh down the country’s growth prospects. The debt clearance strategy is expected to give impetus to the Second Republic’s target of making Zimbabwe an upper-middle-class economy by 2030. The meeting that took place this week follows an initial dialogue held on the 1st of December 2022 involving the Government and various stakeholders.
