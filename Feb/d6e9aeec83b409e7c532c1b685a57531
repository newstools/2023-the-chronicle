The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO is set to host the Zimbabwe Closed Junior Squash Championship which is scheduled to start on Friday February 17 and conclude the following day. The tournament’s matches will take place at three venues, Old Miltonians, Christian Brothers’ College (CBC) and Suburbs Squash Club.
The championship will also be used as part of team selection for Zimbabwe thus players are encouraged to take part in it.
At the upcoming event, protective eyewear is compulsory for all players. Interest in the sport has been reignited with Zimbabwe set to host the 2023 World Squash Federation (WSF) level one coaching course in March and April at St John’s College in Harare. The event will take place from March 31 to April 2 at St John’s College in Harare. Liz Mackenzie will be the course facilitator.  The event will feature coaches from outside the country as some from Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and Zanzibar have already shown interest.
Last year, Zimbabwe hosted the 2022 Senior Championships in Bulawayo across four different venues which was the first of its kind in years much to the pleasure of WSF who congratulated SFA on a job well done. During the championships, powerhouse Egypt proved why they are a force to reckon with in the sport winning both the men and women’s events in the teams’ section. The North Africans won both the matches against South Africa to secure gold. — @brandon_malvin
