The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE senior women’s cricket team batter, Sharne Mayers has registered for the inaugural 2023 Women’s Premier League in India which is scheduled to take place in March. The Lady Chevrons star completed the player registration which closed on Thursday January 26 and is now awaiting the auction whose dates are yet to be confirmed. Mayers, who is ranked number 20 in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Women T20 batting rankings could become the first Zimbabwean female player to take part in the new tournament if she is picked by one of the five clubs that will be competing.  She is the highest-ranked Zimbabwean female batter in the shortest version of the game with a rating of 564 points. The following player is Modester Mupachikwa in position 29 with 533 points. In the shortest version of the match, Mayers has played 22 matches for Zimbabwe, racking up 527 runs in the process at an average of 31.0 and a strike rate of 109. 79. She has three half-centuries and a career-high score of 68 not out which came against Namibia in Windhoek last year. The opening batter was also part of the Lady Chevrons side that fell short of booking a place in this year’s T20 World Cup which will be played in South Africa. The final decision for the player auction has also not been confirmed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). <img class="wp-image-646248 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-49.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-49.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-49-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lady Chevrons The league will be an Indian Premier League (IPL) style for female cricketers and is likely to be played between March 4 and March 24, a tight window squeezed out between the Women’s T20 World Cup that ends in late February and the men’s IPL that is set to start one week after the women’s competition. Each team can buy a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 18 players, including seven overseas ones, of which one must be from an Associate country and Mayers could follow in the footsteps of male counterpart Sikandar Raza who was bought by Punjab Kings for the upcoming edition of the IPL. – @brandon_malvin
