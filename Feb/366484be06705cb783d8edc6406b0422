The Chronicle Angela Sibanda, Showbiz Correspondent GROWING up in the dusty streets of Gokwe and being regarded as the most shy and quiet child in his family, Washington Dube never imagined himself being Master of Ceremonies (MC) let alone one in demand in Zimbabwe. It all started with a little situation at his friend’s wedding in 2016 in Bulawayo, when the MC was late and there was a need for someone to keep people entertained and maintain order as they queued for food, and Washington volunteered to do the job. He impressed a guest who hired him to MC at his wedding and this opened doors to more and more opportunities until he attained a reputation as one of the best MCs in Bulawayo.
Popularly known as Washie the MC, he is one of the most sought-after MCs who has hosted many weddings across the country and in South Africa. <img class="wp-image-682528 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dfvsvsdf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dfvsvsdf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/dfvsvsdf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Washie the MC Last year, he shared the stage with Harare-based radio and television personality Rebecca Mushenje at award-winning gospel artiste Everton Mlalazi’s homecoming and album at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF).
Washie was born in rural Gokwe and soon after Grade 7, he moved to Bulawayo and is currently residing in Burnside suburb. “Getting in the arts industry and becoming an MC was a mistake. It was a blessing in disguise and it shocked everyone within my circle. My mum who still resides in rural Gokwe was really shocked the first time she heard that I was now an MC in town.
“When it started, I was just helping the wedding to progress as we waited for the MC who was one reputable and respected man within our social circles whose work I respected so much that I declined the offer to proceed with the rest of the ceremony. All I did was help people get food, maintain order, but after the event, I had people approaching me and saying that the few minutes that I had the mic were amazing,” said Washie. His first wedding in Harare was another unexpected adventure after a couple picked him at a local restaurant and he immediately got hired for their wedding.
“One day I was sitting in a restaurant with my friends narrating my experience with the first wedding and how it surprised me to see everyone clapping for me after the session. It happened that a couple that was sitting at the table behind us was getting married and did not have an MC.  “They overheard the conversation, so they engaged me and the next thing I was officiating at their wedding,” he said.
“When I first started, I didn’t know that I was supposed to charge people for the services. For me, it was just a new adventure that I really enjoyed. For the first nine weddings that I officiated, I only went there, did my job and ate nice food and went back home feeling satisfied but I did receive money or goods which came as a token of appreciation afterwards. “It was through the assistance of one of the mothers from church who is into catering for corporate events and she advised me to have a price for my work because she believed I was not giving myself the value that my work deserved. My first payment was a suit that I charged a South African couple because all along I had been operating in two suits which almost everyone was now familiar with,” he said.
Washie soon realised that a suit did not make him stand out like a sore thumb so he got an Arabic suit. It has since become his signature dress code. “A friend of mine, who was working in Iraq around 2017, got me an Arabic outfit and I had been keeping it not sure of where I would wear it in this part of the world. Then at some point, I ran out of attires for this one wedding and I decided to just wear the outfit.
“First, I was not so sure about this move, it was risky and I was a little uncomfortable in it. To my surprise, people really loved it and all invitations that came after my appearance with the outfit were specific that I should make sure that I put it on,” he said. <img class="wp-image-679737 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ooihuy6ytfrfyhu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ooihuy6ytfrfyhu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ooihuy6ytfrfyhu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Everton Mlalazi From then, he has had to add more similar outfits to his closet and the Arabic outfit has become his own signature in the industry.
“Before I became an MC, I was working as a butcher attendant and I was very comfortable in it. I know now that God had his own plans for me. I grew up very shy but through the SDA church, I learnt to stand and talk to groups of people during services and I am very grateful to the teachings and training that I received at a young age, because they all started to bloom as I got older. “At first I would get nervous or get stage fright before events, especially at the beginning, but now I can stand in front of new faces daily and nothing scares me, I just do my job and enjoy every moment.
“I have hosted events for people that I never saw myself getting close to and shared the table with achievers who have impacted my life and helped me grow as a brand and as an individual. “I have also officiated events for people from countries like Angola and I recently hosted a wedding for an Australian couple in South Africa who were doing a getaway wedding,” said Washie. He is fluent in four languages, namely English, isiNdebele, chiShona and Tonga.
“When it comes to languages I am blessed because I can learn the basics within a short time. I speak many languages although I am currently fluent in just four and also learning some international languages online,” he said.
