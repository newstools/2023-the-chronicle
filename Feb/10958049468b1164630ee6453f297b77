Da L.E.S featured in several AKA’s hits including All Eyes on Me which also featured international star Burna Boy and JR. Other celebrities such as DJ Black Coffee also posted “No ways” reacting to news of AKA’s shooting.  The news of AKA’s death also shook the entertainment industry in Zimbabwe as Jah Prayzah also conveyed his disbelief. “Never got to cross paths but no one can underplay the influence AKA had on the global music scene representing Africa, we have lost a real one. Rest In Eternal Peace Brother Cassper Nyovest and AKA had been in a hip-hop beef for years with both taking verbal shots at each other be it in public, on social media or in music. Rapper Asaph also posted saying the brutal death of AKA reminded him of how Cal_Vin died in 2020. “Why rappers gotta die so violently. Got me thinking about Cal like that sh** could happen here too.” Awakhiwe also expressed that AKA’s death was so brutal and she had flashbacks of when Cal_Vin died. At the height of their beef, AKA released the track Composure dissing Cassper Nyovest, who then released a response titled Dust 2 Dust. The artistes’ beef spilt into Zimbabwe, Bulawayo to be particular when they performed at the Kalawa Homecoming show in 2015 as headliners. Cassper and AKA reportedly refused to sit in the same enclosure, while AKA is alleged to have refused to perform after Cassper. Therefore, AKA performed before Cassper with the late rapper Cal_Vin entertaining the crowd between the two. <img class="wp-image-573509 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Cal_vin.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Cal_vin.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/Cal_vin-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Late rapper Cal_Vin The beef between the two has been on and off and Cassper challenged AKA to a boxing match which did not materialise. It seemed that the two artistes had “kissed and made up” as they were spotted hugging at a night spot some years ago.
