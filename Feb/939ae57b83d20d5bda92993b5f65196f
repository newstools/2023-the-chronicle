The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief A UNITED Kingdom-based dentist, Dr Shamiso Ketani (54) has transformed his 210-hectare piece of land in Somabula near Gweru in the Midlands Province into a thriving farming project, specialising in Beauregard sweet potatoes and is eyeing the export market. Beauregard sweet potatoes are large in size with a uniform, oblong to an elliptical shape, slightly tapering to small points on both ends. The long tuber has semi-smooth skin that ranges in colour from copper, red-brown, to purple-brown, and is firm with a few shallow divots and markings. Underneath the surface, the dark orange flesh is dense, moist and fine-grained. When cooked, Beauregard sweet potatoes develop a tender, soft and creamy consistency with a sweet and slightly nutty flavour.
Beauregard sweet potatoes are best suited for cooked applications such as baking, frying, boiling, steaming, pureeing and mashing. The fine-grained tuber has a smooth and tender consistency when cooked, which allows it to be used in a wide variety of culinary applications such as in pies, muffins, bread, crescent rolls and casseroles. The shift towards more traditional foods has seen a huge demand for these crops which are rich in natural sugars. Sweet potatoes are adaptable to traditional farming systems, drought tolerant, perform well in relatively poor soils and have low labour requirements.  They also require little attention due to their aggressive growth habits, mature early, are easy to cultivate and process.
Dr Ketani said his target market for the sweet potatoes is Dubai. “We have planted Beauregard sweet potatoes at our plot in Somabula and the produce is earmarked for the export market. The crop is progressing well in the field in about 60 -70 days from now we will be harvesting,” he said. Dr Ketani said after harvesting the crop, the buyer from Dubai will have a sample of the crop.
“If the buyer is satisfied then we will get an off-take agreement which will then indicate how much sweet potatoes he wants. We will then grow based on what we would have agreed on in terms of quantity and price,” he said. <img class="size-large wp-image-684609" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ridges-of-Beauregard-sweet-potatoes-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ridges-of-Beauregard-sweet-potatoes.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ridges-of-Beauregard-sweet-potatoes-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Ketani said they have been working on developing the seed since last year.
