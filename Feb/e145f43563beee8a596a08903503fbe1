In his remarks, Eversharp general manager, Mr Thomas Nyahasha, said the opening of the regional office in the city after 50 years of service was a special way of saying “thank you” to the people of Bulawayo for always supporting the business and being faithful to the brand. He said the new offices will also serve as a selling point and assured the Bulawayo market of great services. “It’s a special and great building that we have opened up. We felt it had been necessary for a long time but things have been difficult for us as we were affected by Covid-19,” said Mr Nyahasha. “We really needed a branch and office to reflect the importance of Bulawayo and the Southern region to our business.  “This opening is very special after 50 years of operating and it shows how strong we are. We are a hundred percent Zimbabwean product as Eversharp is originally produced here in Zimbabwe. We are really proud that we have been able to stand the test of time.” Mr Nyahasha assured the market of enhanced and continuous product availability as well as broadening of the product range. “There will be various Eversharp pens, pencils, rulers, mighty markers, and other stationery that are going to come through,” he said. “This is why we have opened this sales office to cater to our growing business. This is just the beginning and as our company grows, we expect to expand even further and open up more sales offices in Zimbabwe.” The official opening event also afforded guests the opportunity to ask questions with the company responding while lucky winners walked away with tokens such as stationery, which included books, book covers, rulers, and pens. <img class="wp-image-616608 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-226.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-226.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-226-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Eversharp pens One of the attendees, Ms Cynthia Nkomo from Nketa 6 suburb, said the opening of the new office will ease the burden of buying fake products in Bulawayo. “I’m really excited about this opening.
