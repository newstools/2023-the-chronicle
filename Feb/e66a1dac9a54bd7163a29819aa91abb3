The Chronicle Fungai Muderere FORMER Chicken Inn fringe player Bravie Ayanda Sibanda is now plying his trade in Slovakia where he now turns out for that country’s third league side OFK Baník Lehota pod Vtácnikom. It was a golden opportunity for Sibanda who joined OFK Baník Lehota pod Vtácnikom as a free agent from Swaziland’s premiership side Tambankulu Callies on a one a year contract with an option to renew. In an interview from his base in Slovakia, Sibanda said besides some language barrier experiences, he was already feeling at home hence his scoring of three goals in four outings so far after signing what he described as a lucrative deal.   “I should say the deal financially benefited me. Playing in Europe is better than playing in Africa. Football is always football and the language used in the game is the same so there is not much change. Here they speak Slovak with a few people that speak English meaning at times I tend to experience some language barrier challenges. I have however adapted well,” said Sibanda who also briefly did duty for Swaziland’s Manzi Wanderers. He said he has been a regular member of his new team and has so far scored three goals in the four games he has played. In Slovakia, Sibanda boasts of an impressive strike rate of 1.3 goals per match in a league that he says is very competitive. <img class="wp-image-599500 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Bravie-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Bravie-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Bravie-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bravie Sibanda “Its high intensity football as opponents don’t give each other so much space and as such there is little time to think on the next move,” said Sibanda. He scored a brace when OFK Baník Lehota pod Vtácnikom thumped OSK Trencianske Stankouce 4-1 before he struck once when his new paymasters walloped FC Banik 4-2. During his days at Chicken Inn, Sibanda who turns 26 in July, struggled to command a starting place together with the combative duo of Ben Nyahunzvi and Phakamani Dube, left back Nyasha Gurende and gritty Joe Nyabinde among others. Nyahunzvi now does duty for rebuilding Castle Lager Premiership side Bulawayo Chiefs. Gurende turned out for Bulawayo City last season while pint sized Nyabinde was with army side Black Rhinos. Dube, who is also a former Hwange and Dynamos right back, briefly featured for ZPC Kariba before he fizzled out. — @FungaiMuderere
