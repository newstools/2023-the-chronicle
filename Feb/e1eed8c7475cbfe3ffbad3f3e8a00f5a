I would’ve went to the funeral too. No matter how you look at it, me and Kiernan shared a lot of great moments together and he contributed to my industry so I have to pay my respects,” he tweeted. His tweet was met with mixed reactions with some suggesting that he should cancel his international trip and attend the memorial service whilst others said he should go ahead. <img class="size-large wp-image-416902" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Cassper-680x406.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Cassper.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Cassper-360x215.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cassper Nyovest The responses were seemingly emanating from the past beef stories between the AKA and Nyovest which has been on and off over the years and at some point, Cassper challenged the late AKA to a boxing match which did not materialise. It however, seemed that the two artists had resolved their issues as they were spotted hugging at a night spot some years ago. <img class="size-large wp-image-680499" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-8-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-8-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-8-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late SA rapper AKA AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, was shot dead on Friday night in Durban, South Africa along with his close friend, the chef and entrepreneur Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane on their way to a nightclub for Forbes’ birthday celebration show. <img class="size-large wp-image-680948" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Crime-Jayde-750x423-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Crime-Jayde-750x423.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Crime-Jayde-750x423-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The crime scene where rapper AKA and friend Tibz were shot and killed in Durban.
