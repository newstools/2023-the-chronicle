PENSIONERS say their local dollar monthly payments are no longer enough for their upkeep and have pleaded with the Government to facilitate an upward review in line with exchange rate movements or alternatively shift to foreign currency payments. This emerged during a recent meeting held at Tshabalala Hall between pensioners in Bulawayo and Bulawayo South legislator, Raj Modi, who is also Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce. The meeting was meant to afford pensioners the opportunity to present their challenges to Government as well as engage with their leadership.  In their submissions, most pensioners said monthly allowances were no longer sustainable and also complained over restrictive withdrawal limits at banks, saying this frustrates their purchasing ability. One of the pensioners, Mr Albert Mlilo, urged the Government to urgently review the pension payments to restore their purchasing power. “We ask the Government to intervene and help address the challenges we are facing. Before the introduction of payment in local RTGS, a pensioner was getting around US$200,” he said. “This was manageable but now we are getting ZW$20 000, which at times is rated at highly inflated prices out there.
“At the end of the day, the pension does not do much justice in catering for our daily needs.” <img class="wp-image-629200 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-10-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-10-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-10-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pensions Mr Mlilo said the elderly citizens were unable to stand for several hours queueing at banks only to get a small amount.
He said what gives them a challenge at most times is the withdrawal rate at banks which is low. “We wish that at least the Government could address that and help us. What is really stressing is that the withdrawal amount at most banks is ZW$ 5000 a week, which is something like US$5,” he said. “How will I manage to buy basic commodities that are required with only such an amount, when most basic commodities are overpriced and that amount can only buy me a packet of sugar and a loaf of bread.” <img class="wp-image-591033 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bond-Notes.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bond-Notes.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Bond-Notes-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> RTGS Other pensioners appealed for assistance in starting their own income-generating projects among other non-monetary benefits. “Instead of seeing us always cry foul every day, the Government should come up with means of empowering us in projects that will generate our own income while at the same time benefiting the communities and the country as well,” said Mr Everson Msimanga. “This includes projects like goat farming, and poultry farming at the same time giving discounts at participating shops, as well as assistance with medical care, among others.” Pensioners also requested that the Government facilitates the reopening of the Post Office in Tshabalala to provide services at the local level. In this regard, Mrs Judith Moyo said the reopening of the post office will help reduce congestion at banks in the city centre where everyone goes to collect their pension. <img class="alignnone wp-image-675569 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/layers-battery-cage-system-of-chicken-farming.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/layers-battery-cage-system-of-chicken-farming.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/layers-battery-cage-system-of-chicken-farming-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In his response, Deputy Minister Modi pledged to take the concerns raised to Parliament for further engagement and coming up with a lasting solution. “I assure you as the community of Tshabalala and surrounding suburbs that what you have raised during this meeting will be taken up and I will make sure to work with the rightful ministers and departments in addressing your pleas,” he said. – @Sagepapie14
