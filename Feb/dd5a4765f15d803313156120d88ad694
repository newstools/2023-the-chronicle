Renkini Bus Terminus was, for years, the nerve centre for Bulawayo’s transport system with people intending to travel to other cities and towns trooping to the station to board buses. Many others were dropped off at the terminus as well but today, the bus station is a pale shadow of its former self after several buses that ply intercity routes decided to shun it. <img class="wp-image-679929 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/y8iu8iupokij.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/y8iu8iupokij.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/y8iu8iupokij-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Renkini vendor Mr Witness Ncube Located in Makokoba, the city’s oldest suburb, Renkini Bus Terminus is a white elephant. Most inter-city buses which used to rank at the terminus, have abandoned the place and are now using undesignated areas in the city centre as pick up and drop off points, violating council by-laws. The development has created congestion in the city centre, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk on pavements.
Some bus transporters who used to operate from an illegal bus rank along Leopold Takawira Avenue near Centenary Park have moved to another illegal rank along 4th Avenue behind Eveline High School. The transporters who are shunning Renkini Bus Terminus, have moved together with touts and vendors, creating a chaotic scene in the city centre. <img class="wp-image-679938 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/bvvgb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/bvvgb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/bvvgb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Renkini vendor Ms Sandra Chinembiri Last month, Bulawayo residents urged Government to consider extending the suspension of operating licences to errant public transport operators who flout traffic rules and regulations by picking and dropping passengers at undesignated places in Bulawayo.
