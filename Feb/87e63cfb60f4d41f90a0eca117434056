Bulawayo Zanu-PF province yesterday held its Provincial Coordinating Committee Meeting (PCC) ahead of the cell verification exercise which starts this week as the ruling party gears up for this year’s harmonised elections. The meeting was held at Davis Hall, the party’s provincial headquarters. Cde Judith Ncube, who is the party’s Women’s league Deputy Secretary and also the Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Cde Molly Mpofu, (Zanu-PF Secretary for Gender and Culture), Cde Elifasi Mashaba (Secretary for Business Development), Zanu-PF Bulawayo province vice chairman Cde Victor Mpofu nd Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Cde Raj Modi are among senior party officials who attended the meeting.  The revolutionary party is on a nationwide drive to mobilise five million votes ahead of the forthcoming harmonised elections. Last year Zanu-PF introduced a National Cell Day, which will be celebrated annually to strengthen its grassroots, organisational and mass mobilisation units. This is part of the scaling up of the Revolutionary Party’s mass mobilisation strategies as it gears for a resounding victory in the upcoming harmonised elections. Speaking after the PCC meeting, Zanu-PF provincial secretary for Information and Publicity, Cde Archie Chiponda said the exercise is aimed at verifying party members and further strengthening its cell structures. <img class="wp-image-678549 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/grbgfn-m.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/grbgfn-m.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/grbgfn-m-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF PCC Meeting at Davis Hall “This is our cell verification exercise and as an organised party, we hold this exercise every year. This is because there is mobility in our structures. So, when the year begins, we check our registers,” he said. Cde Chiponda said the verification process is crucial as Zanu-PF wants nothing less than a resounding victory this year. “This year is very crucial because we are having general elections and this is part of the process to make sure that the party is in good shape,” he said. Meanwhile, in Matabeleland South, Zanu-PF PCC will be holding a one-week outreach programme in all seven districts of the province to review development programmes. Speaking in an interview after a special PCC meeting on Saturday, the party’s provincial chairperson, Cde Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, said the programme is critical in the mobilisation process. He said it will help the revolutionary party to win resoundingly in the province. <img class="wp-image-669124 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/CGFRHGJHY.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/CGFRHGJHY.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/CGFRHGJHY-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu Cde Ndlovu said the provincial party leadership has compiled a consolidated report on the programmes that have been implemented. “We will be rolling out a programme which will start on Thursday and run for seven days. The PCC will be visiting all seven administrative districts starting with Umzingwane followed by Gwanda, Beitbridge, Insiza, Bulilima, Mangwe and lastly Matobo District,” he said. “Our programme has four key issues, the first being to communicate to our party structures that our President has delivered as he had promised in 2018. We still have the pledge that he made to the people, but we have consolidated all the works done.” Cde Ndlovu said they are looking at devolution and the performance of Government departments in each administrative district to ward level. “We want to highlight to the people that there has never been a better performing political leader like President Mnangagwa,” he said. <img class="wp-image-624268 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-32-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu-PF Cde Ndlovu said the PCC will also take advantage of their visits to various districts to ensure that party structures are in good standing. He said they will also get rid of any mischief that is creeping into the party. He said the PCC will also map out its vote mobilisation strategy. Cde Ndlovu said this will help to ensure that the province votes resoundingly for President Mnangagwa and Zanu-PF. Cde Ndlovu said the PCC will also use the programme to interact with people to find out outstanding development issues they want addressed. “We will also interact with our structures at grassroot level to find out if there any critical issues which they would like the party and the Government to address so that they can be taken on board. We are not just going there to address them as it will be two-way communication,” he said. <img class="wp-image-677632 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa “We believe that this programme will be comprehensive enough to convince people to vote for the President and Zanu-PF.” Cde Ndlovu recently urged party members to have detailed information on the achievements of  both the Government and party under President Mnangagwa. “The Zanu-PF led Government under the visionary leadership of President Mnangagwa has recorded significant progress in fulfilling its mantra of leaving no one and no place behind,” he said. “Previously marginalised groups in society such as people with disability have been empowered through projects and assistive devices. Government under the Second Republic has  rolled out various infrastructural development projects which will have a huge impact on the economy in the Matabeleland region such  as the Lake Gwayi- Shangani in Hwange District, Matabeleland North and Tuli-Manyange Dam in Gwanda, Matabeleland South. – @DubeMatutu.
