The man argues that he can’t waste his family’s resources on a woman who has changed her character over the years as she has become a drunkard. “The idea behind the EP is to create a discussion and seek answers of the qualities needed for a woman to be said she deserves to have lobola paid for her,” said Intombi Yabelungu. She called upon fans to support her latest work. – @mthabisi_mthire
