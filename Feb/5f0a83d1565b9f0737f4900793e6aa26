He also spoke about the genesis of sanctions, which came about following the implementation of the land reform programme. “We didn’t have a formula of getting stolen land from thieves, so we used our domestic resources. So we decided to take our land. “As a result, sanctions were imposed on us.” He said even though the economy and the currency faced some challenges, the people remained resolute.
He praised Finance and Economic Development, Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, for steering the economy towards a growth trajectory.  President Mnangagwa said the two countries, as Pan Africanists, should “share what we have in terms of skills and resources”. On his part, President Mbasogo said the global south to south is “our only hope in Africa”.
“As Africans, we should not expect anything from nobody,” he said. “The resources of this country must not only belong to the people of Equatorial Guinea but to other Africans.” Speaking ahead of the signing ceremony, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Frederick Shava, said there were six MOUs signed in total and these include “reciprocity in visas, and cooperation in sectors such as tourism, mining, and agriculture”. <img class="wp-image-663486 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-3-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-3-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-3-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Professor Mthuli Ncube Minister Ncube added that the agreements will also include one on “investor protection in form of Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA)”.
