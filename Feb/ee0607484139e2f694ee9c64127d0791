The Chronicle Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi on Thursday confirmed that his office had not succeeded in getting permission from the Presidency to give Kiernan “AKA” Forbes a state funeral. Lesufi denied the request was for a financial contribution. He said the province wanted to honour the rapper by draping his coffin with the South African flag and to fly the flag at half-mast.
