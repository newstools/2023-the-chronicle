COMMUNITIES in Tsholotsho’s flood prone areas are on alert in case of any disaster, an official has said.
This comes as close to 20 learners from Jimila School were last week affected by floods after they failed to cross a flooded Gwayi River which filled up when they were at school during the day. The learners were all assisted to cross back to their villages the following day and there were no casualties.
More than 300 families were affected by Cyclone Dineo-induced floods in 2017 and Government relocated them.  The district has started a process of updating the District Disaster Risk Management Plan which was last updated in 2014 to ensure that all sectors and communities are alert in case of floods. Tsholotsho District Development Coordinator Mr Aaron Gono said a majority of community members were on alert in case of any floods. “After we did our disaster risk drills it seems the message reached the people and we haven’t experienced any serious challenges as people are now aware. When it rains they cross to new houses and return during dry periods,” said Mr Gono. <img class="wp-image-680010 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fghswfrefr.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fghswfrefr.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fghswfrefr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tsholotsho stakeholders during a disaster management planning meeting He said the district is working with various stakeholders including Government departments and private sector to build resilient villages and households and make sure floods are under control. Some of the organisations are Welthungerhilfe, Caritas Zimbabwe. “The flood situation is under control because we have managed to control community structures. We had a situation at Jimila where 17 learners were affected and could not cross the river after school and we managed through the Civil Protection Committee to assist with food items. “In terms of our preparedness and recovery plan we are on high alert. Our disaster risk management plan was last updated in 2014 and we are now trying to update it to be in line with current trends and show resilience to climate change,” said Mr Gono. Mr Gono expressed concern that some of the victims of the 2017 floods who were allocated houses on new stands were reluctant to occupy them in Tshino and Sawudweni as they remain in flood prone areas. He however said awareness campaigns will continue to make sure everyone is on safe ground. The areas that are most prone to floods are Mahlosi, Mahlaba, Thamuhla, Mbamba, Mele, Lutshome, Maphili and Mbanyana. —@ncubeleon
