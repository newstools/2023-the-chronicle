Tourism operators in Matabeleland South have implored Government to decentralise key services which are still concentrated in Harare. Contributing during a tourism stakeholder engagement workshop hosted by Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry in Gwanda recently, stakeholders drawn from a cross section of the sector said there is also a need for identification and development of tourism destinations which remain idle in the province. <img class="wp-image-684962 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/zsxxccvbb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/zsxxccvbb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/zsxxccvbb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Lehlohonolo Mokwena They said there is a need for communities to benefit from destinations in their areas. The stakeholders highlighted Lumene Falls in Umzingwane District as one of the sites which could rake in a lot of money once developed. Hoteliers who attended the meeting said once various tourist destinations are developed in the province it will help to boost their businesses. The Ministry is conducting countrywide consultations to gather stakeholder input towards the review of the National Tourism Policy (NTP).  The review seeks to realign the policy with the goals of the Second Republic, taking cognisance of emerging and future tourism trends. The NTP was crafted in 2014 and has outlived the normal policy lifespan of five years. Government has directed all ministries, departments and agencies to reflect and come up with policies that redefine the course of action to propel their sectors to great heights.
Under the National Development Strategy (NDS1) tourism is one of the critical pillars of Zimbabwe’s economy and the sector has a target of achieving US$5 billion earnings by 2025. Ms Sithembinkosi Nyathi who operates Apex Lodge said communities have to play a crucial role in identifying tourist sites in the province. <img class="wp-image-684965 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/frftggghhhj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/frftggghhhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/frftggghhhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stakeholders from Matabeleland South during a National Tourism Policy consultative meeting in Gwanda “If we look at the direction which Government is taking us you will realise that there is need to review the National Tourism Policy. We need a policy that will incorporate everyone and leave no one or place behind starting from our communities up to national level. Let’s start by involving our communities so that we can identify the tourist sites that we have. It’s important that we market these locally, nationally and globally,” she said. “There is need for structures that favour ease of doing business. There is duplication of services as we have to go through different offices for almost the same thing. This new policy can assist with creation of a one stop centre which can allow us to do some of the processes under one roof. Most of the services are centralised in Harare, for example for licences we have to submit applications in Harare. If I need to get a rebate on purchases I have to go to Harare.” Mr Lehlohonolo Mokwena who operates Mount Cazalet Lodge said Government has to put in place measures to make tourist destinations accessible to locals. He said locals also have to enjoy and benefit from tourism destinations in their areas. <img class="wp-image-684959 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sfgvvh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sfgvvh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sfgvvh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Sithembinkosi Nyathi “As locals we have to take an active part in development our tourism sector. Its development doesn’t only require foreigners but it also needs our input. Some of these tourist destinations are beyond the reach of locals because of costs. Locals that come in on a daily basis at subsidised prices can bring in a lot of revenue compared to none at all,” he said. Mr Mokwena said if more tourist sites in the province are identified and developed then hoteliers will record good business as tourists will be flocking to the province. He said in the process the policy has to recognise traditional leaders as some of the tourist sites are cultural and sacred. Mr Mokwena said traditional leaders have to play a significant role in identifying these sites. Speaking in Gweru recently Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said tourism has great potential and capacity to make significant contributions to the national economy. He noted that from January to November 2022, the sector registered an increase of 163 percent in tourist arrivals from 340 000 in 2021 to 895 338 in 2022. Similarly, tourism receipts increased by 133 percent from US$288,8 million in 2021 to US$672,9 million in 2022. He said tourism investments rose by 239 percent from US$90,4 million to US$306,7 million, compared to the same period in 2021. The average hotel room occupancy also showed significant growth in the first 11 months of 2022, as it grew by 17 percent from 27 percent in 2021 to 44 percent in 2022. The consultative programme which is being conducted in all provinces is in line with the Government policy on devolution. – @DubeMatutu.
