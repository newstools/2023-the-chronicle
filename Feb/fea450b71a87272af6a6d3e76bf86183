The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victora Falls Reporter TWO hundred and fifty people in Hwange have been capacitated with skills to produce various  products and establish their own enterprises. After a week-long training session focused on three categories-tourism and hospitality, nurse aide and detergents making, 250 people graduated on Saturday. The programme is being spearheaded through a partnership between Tonganyika Trust founded by Cde Tongai Mnangagwa in 2017 and MenBelievED Matabeleland North. Training started last week and culminated in a mini-graduation ceremony at Lwendulu Hall on Saturday where beneficiaries received certificates and are capacitated to start their own companies and businesses. Tonganyika Trust trainer Mr Lloyd Muzenda said the goal of the programme is to capacitate communities to be able to contribute to their local economies and help Government achieve its economic vision. “This is a skills development programme aimed at helping people become self-reliant and also contribute to their communities’ economy as well as help Government Vision 2030 and to attain its goals for an upper middle income society. We want people to see how Zanu-PF is helping develop our citizens,” he  said.  MenBelievED is an organisation established to support President Mnangagwa and the Second Republic’s agenda. <img class="wp-image-678997 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cvfvgvv.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cvfvgvv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cvfvgvv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa MenBelievED Matabeleland North chairperson Mr Allan Twalumba said more people will be trained in Binga. “As MenBelievED we have identified the need to equip our community with skills so that they can start their businesses.
