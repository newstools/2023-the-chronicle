A self-made award winning Hip Hop artist from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe  has challenged himself to make better music and be the entertainer the audience seeks integrating the culture of hip hop. Luminous ended the year 2022 in style as he scooped the Roil BAA award for the outstanding hip hop act and earlier in the month of December he won the best live act at the Zim hip hop awards. Luminous was part of the line up of entertainers at the roil awards and he gave a stellar performance with his hit single Ungay’vusa. The hip hop rapper started off his career in battle rap and has never lost a battle which became the foundation of his musical journey. He has released an EP Nkulumane Drive and an album titled Driven. <img class="wp-image-577372 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Luminous32.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Luminous32.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Luminous32-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Luminous “I have never been that fussy about getting accolades but winning in both the Roil BAA and the Zim Hip Hop has been amazing especially for my team and supporters because they love the show I put on,” said Luminous. Since he made his first appearance for over a decade now, he has been releasing a series of singles with Ungay’vusa being the latest. Luminous has enjoyed rotation on Zifm Stereo, Skyz Metro FM, Khulumani FM, Star FM. “Consistency has paid off for me, I have been in this grind for ten years and still counting and it’s only now that people eventually realise my talent or acknowledge any of my works. This means so much more to me and my team,” said Luminous. He has performed at the recently held Shoko Arts Festival, Iyasa’s Prove Concert, Fiwale, Zambia BC Youth Conference, The Bulawayo Arts Awards. The Hip Hop sensation was also nominated for Best newcomer and People’s choice awards in the Zim hip Hop Awards. “2023 we are definitely grabbing all the opportunities that come my way with the rest of my management.

He also secured collaborations as far Cameroon and some of his songs have been playlisted on Volcao, a radio station in Chicago and also appeared on UK based radio NamRadio.  “I won’t be releasing any album soon, will dedicate some time to my wellbeing and venture into other hustles. For the time being me and my management will be promoting my last Ep titled Love, Sex and the Gospel as well as a book which I dropped last year hence I will take these to different places,” said Luminous. The rapper promised to drop a few singles in the time being but not an album. He’s been on the move to promote his book as well as his Ep whilst considering other life aspects.
