The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief VARIOUS stakeholders in Filabusi in Insiza District, Matabeleland South, have come up with new strategies aimed at addressing the problem of littering which has gone out of hand in the area and posing a health threat. The stakeholders comprising members of the business community, residents and heads of Government departments, and other organisations came up with a work plan which will help clean the district in both rural and urban areas.
In an interview, Insiza district development coordinator, Mr Zacharia Jusah said the move is in compliance with the Government’s directive to keep the environment clean. Following the inception of the National Clean-Up, which takes place on the first Friday of every month in 2018, President Mnangagwa has been spearheading the campaign to make communities cleaner.
The programme, which seeks to raise awareness on the importance of a clean environment for sustainable socio-economic development, has been a success as it has reached all the corners of the country. <img class="alignnone wp-image-484347 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/waste-disposal1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/waste-disposal1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/waste-disposal1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Jusah said in addition to the usual monthly clean-up exercise, the stakeholders saw it fit to do more towards keeping the environment clean.
“The litter which we have in the streets comprises of plastics, paper, pampers, bottles, human waste and clothing. From this, we see that everyone in the area is a culprit when it comes to littering,” he said. “We identified litter hotspots and they are mainly business centres and also in the rural areas. At the household level, there are some houses which don’t have water and toilets and people end up relieving themselves in the bushes.”
Mr Jusah said some shops are operating without functional toilets, refuse bins and waste bag pits. “Public cages are meant for the population which is in transit, but they are also used by the shops that don’t have bins which causes them to fill up quickly thereby leading to littering,” he said.
Mr Jusah said some homes lack waste bins resulting in occupants disposing of their litter outside their yards.
He said their campaign seeks to bring all stakeholders on board in the fight against littering and urged residents to take responsibility.  “We agreed that all urban shops should have bought plastic bins while rural shops must have constructed litter pits behind their shops by 28 February. All bars must have bought cages by 30 March instead of them using cages that are meant for the public,” said Mr Jusah.
“All houses without water and toilets have to be identified so that the Public Health Act and the Building by-laws can be enforced. We will also hold a health and business indaba so that people can be trained on recycling waste as it can be turned into a source of income.”
Mr Jusah said the stakeholders also agreed that, in addition to the monthly clean-up, there is also a need for coordinated weekly clean-up activities.
He said follow ups will be made to ensure that stakeholders adhere to the recommendations. Mr Jusah said a clean environment is key in ensuring that the district attracts investors. — @DubeMatutu
