The Chronicle    Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter A two-day capacity-building workshop to unpack the Mines and Minerals Bill is underway in Bulawayo where the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development and several stakeholders in the extractive sector are gathered. Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development, Edmund Mkaratigwa, delivered a keynote address this morning in which he highlighted the key components of the Bill that should steer the growth of the mining sector. He said the mining sector contributes more to economic growth as it anchors several budgetary votes ranging from health and education. Key components of the Bill include acquisition and registration of mining rights, while prospecting and pegging on ground reserved against prospecting is also on the agenda. The Bill also covers mining leases, rights of claim holders and land holders. Participants are drawn from the mines and legal sector, Zimbabwe school of Mines and independent mining consultants.
