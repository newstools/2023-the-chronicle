The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief FOR 70 years, Izimnyama Clinic in Mangwe District remained a pipe dream, but now it has since been completed thanks to Government’s devolution agenda. The project was mooted in 1953 but never took off. In the 1980s, the idea to establish the clinic came back into the discourse but nothing materialised. In 2018 the community mobilised resources and with council’s assistance, they managed to put up a slab and after that the project came to a standstill due to financial challenges. In 2022 the local authority allocated funds which it had received from Government under the devolution programme towards construction of the clinic. The devolution funds helped to buy building materials and pay builders. The local community, and local authority, diasporans and World Vision partnered Government to complete the clinic. Since 2019, a total of $47 million devolution funds have been used in the project. World Vision also assisted with US$61 000.  The community and members of the diaspora also played a crucial role as they mobilised funds to build a staff cottage at the clinic. The structure has been completed and authorities are now working on equipping the clinic. Izimnyama Clinic will benefit seven villages. Devolution funds are assisting local authorities fulfill their obligation of ensuring improved access to social amenities across the country through development of key infrastructure such as clinics, classroom blocks, roads, bridges among other facilities. Social amenities and infrastructure development are some of the major pillars of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). <img class="wp-image-624166 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) A villager from the area Ms Sihambile Moyo said the clinic will help to cut costs they incurred when travelling to Plumtree to access health care services. She said they had difficulties especially during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic to access health services. “This clinic will bring huge relief to us and I can’t wait for it to start operating. We have been relying on Plumtree District Hospital which is about 15 kilometres away and in order to get there we have to catch lifts which charge us R60. It becomes very tough when you have an ill person in the house and no money to pay for transport. It’s even worse when there is a medical emergency at night,” she said. “Sometimes we end up foregoing the visit to a health facility to avoid transport costs and resort to home remedies. At least now we will be able to access health care services close by and at any time.” Ms Mcabango Tshabangu, a village health worker from Izimnyama said there have been a number of challenges faced by the community due to the long distance to the nearest health facility. She said some women and young girls have given birth at home after failing to secure transport. Ms Tshabangu said during emergencies they have to hire vehicles and transporters take advantage of people’s desperation and inflate their fares. “This clinic will cater for many households especially the vulnerable groups and the critically ill. We have disabled people with chronic illnesses who take medication on a daily basis and now they will be able to access their medication close by. This will also help to ensure that people don’t default. Having this clinic will also make my work as a village health worker easier,” she said. Ms Tshabangu said Government played a significant role in ensuring the timeous completion of the clinic. She said devolution funds raised enthusiasm among the community members who started working vigorously to see the clinic completed. Mangwe Rural District Council chief executive officer, Mr Bongani Ngwenya said the completion of the clinic is a result of the partnership between Government, community members, the local authority, diasporans and development partner, World Vision. He said the project was the brain child of the community and then other partners came in to make it a success. Mr Ngwenya said the community also provided labour. He said efforts to secure equipment for the clinic are underway and plans are underway to have it commissioned in the next two months. She said devolution funds, council funds and community funds helped to build the structures while World Vision funds helped with powering a borehole, reticulation of water, buying building materials and erecting a perimeter fence. Bulilima East legislator who is also Deputy Minister of Information, Communication, Technology, Postal and Courier Services, Cde Dingumuzi Phuthi said the construction of Izimnyama Clinic is testimony that Government is committed to transforming the health delivery system especially in once marginalised communities. <img class="wp-image-590907 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-6-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-6-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Information Communication Technology Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingumuzi Phuthi “This is a practical example of what able leadership means. The coming in of the Second Republic has brought about great development and Izimnyama community hasn’t been left behind. We have seen the coming of devolution fund which has helped to speed up development projects that had stalled for many years. We also thank Government for it’s open policy which enabled other partners to come in and develop communities,” he said. — @DubeMatutu
