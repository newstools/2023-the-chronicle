The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Sports Editor AFTER playing his first full 90 minutes for this season when he featured in Luton Town’s 1-1 draw with Coventry City on Saturday, Zimbabwean midfielder Marvelous Nakamba has given thanks to the Hatters coaching department for assisting him get back into shape. Nakamba joined English Championship side Luton Town on transfer deadline day on January 31 on loan from Aston Villa until the end of the season. The Zimbabwe Warriors midfield kingpin was forced to move away from Villa Park after being informed that he was not in Unai Emery’s plans despite still having a running contract that expires in June next year. <img class="wp-image-677943 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jjhh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jjhh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/jjhh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nakambaa at Luton When the Hatters defeated Stoke City 1-0 on February 4, Nakamba made his debut off the bench, coming in for Allan Campbell in the 62nd minute. Against Coventry City, Nakamba was given the full 90 minutes by Rob Edwards, the first time he has played an entire match this season after failing to make it into Villa’s starting line-up for the league and cup competitions. Speaking on his and the teams’ performance after the match, the Zimbabwe international said: “It was a good start and then we controlled the game more first half. It was unlucky we conceded a penalty at the end of the first half but we kept on going. We just told ourselves to focus and keep on doing what we’ve been told to do by the coaches.  “It was unlucky we didn’t maximise the chances we got but it was more important that we got those chances and were there in the right time. It is encouraging, now it’s on us as players to give that extra quality to finish them.” Saturday was the first time that Nakamba had played 90 minutes since December 2021. He is grateful to have been given an opportunity by Luton Town and he is eager to put in the work for the Hatters. “It was my first 90 minutes but I’ve been doing some extra training sessions, the technical staff and the coaches have helped me a lot. I’ve been training by myself for some extra training. Physically for me it is not a problem and when I play, I always give everything. “I’m thankful to Luton for giving me the chance, I’m very grateful for the chance and I’m looking forward to giving everything for the team,’’ remarked Nakamba. The move to Luton Town could help rejuvenate Nakamba’s waning football career if he can manage to play regularly. Luton Town are fourth on the English Championship with 49 points and if they remain in the league’s top six, they will  have an opportunity of getting into the playoffs that could see them qualify to play in the English Premier League next season. – @Mdawini_29.
