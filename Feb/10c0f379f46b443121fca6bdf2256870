The Chronicle The Premier League’s case against Manchester City could take up to four years before a verdict is reached, according to one of Britain’s leading sports lawyers Nick De Marco KC. City were rocked on Monday when the Premier League published the findings of a four-year investigation into the club, where they alleged that the defending champions had breached their financial fair play rules 115 times between 2009 and 2023.  City responded swiftly, making it clear that they wanted to challenge the allegations as they insisted they “look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.” De Marco, who has previously defended Derby County and Sheffield Wednesday on financial fair play charges, thinks the process could take years before it is completed – dailyonline.
