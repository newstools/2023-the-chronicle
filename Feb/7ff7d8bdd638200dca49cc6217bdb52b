Upon reporting for work the following morning, the complainant discovered that the safe containing R191 878 was missing and the door to the office had also been tampered with. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said a report was made to the police and investigations led to the arrest of the two suspects. <img class="size-large wp-image-669418" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-16-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-16.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-16-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube “On January 27, 2023, the detectives from CID vehicle theft squad Bulawayo received information which led to the arrest of Elvis Charakupa. He revealed that he shared the stolen money with Mlungiseli Sibanda, who is employed as a bus luggage dispatcher by the same company,” he said. Insp Ncube said the two suspects are assisting with investigations.
“As police we appreciate the level of participation in the fight against crime by members of the public which creates a difficult environment for criminals. “We also urge the business community to use target hardening techniques at their premises by increasing doors and windows burglar bars,” he said.  Charakupa is allegedly linked to some of the armed robberies, which occurred in Bulawayo last year. One of the five suspects who pounced on CBZ Bank’s Fife Street branch in Bulawayo in September last year and got away with more than US$90 000 was recently arrested. Bhekimpilo Ncube (38) of Gwabalanda suburb in Bulawayo allegedly ganged up with four other suspects, three of whom are still at large while one is now deceased, and raided the bank. They masqueraded as genuine customers and queued just like everyone else in the banking hall. When they were about to be served, the gang then pounced on the bank manager and got away with the money. Ncube appeared before Bulawayo regional magistrate Mr Collet Ncube on Wednesday facing armed robbery charges. He was remanded in custody. The incident came barely a month after another raid at a local financial institution where four gun-wielding robbers got away with a total of US$100 000 and R500 000. <img class="size-large wp-image-645848" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-45-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-45.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Untitled-45-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> CBZ Bank branch in Bulawayo that was recently hit by armed robbers The gang intercepted a cash-in-transit Safeguard vehicle outside a money transfer agent in the city centre.
A month earlier, armed robbers also raided the Mukuru branch along 13th Avenue, between Lobengula and Herbert Chitepo Street. Following an increase in armed robbery cases, President Mnangagwa last August granted an amnesty to all members of the public who are in possession of unregistered firearms and ammunition who surrender the weapons to the police.
