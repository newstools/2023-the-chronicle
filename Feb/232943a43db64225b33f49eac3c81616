The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter GOVERNMENT has started the process of assisting Zimbabweans in South Africa who wish to return home ahead of the expiry of their permits in June this year. An estimated 170 000 holders Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP) have until the end of June to migrate to mainstream South African permits. There are four different permits available namely, student visa, business visa, spousal visa, and work permit visa that one must apply for at South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs.  Applicants must find one that best suits their situation but there are strict conditions for getting permits. For one to get a student visa, they ought to provide proof of being admitted to a registered learning institution. Students are required to provide proof of medical cover renewed annually for the period of study with a medical scheme registered in terms of the Medical Schemes Act. To get a work visa, the applicant must prove they are filling a critical skill post and that their employer cannot find an equally qualified South African for the job. In a statement yesterday, Zimbabwe’s Embassy in South Africa said Government has decided to assist those who wish to return home due to the impending expiry of ZEP. <img class="wp-image-638167 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Travellers-waiting-for-clearance-at-the-new-bus-terminal-at-the-Beitbridge-Border-Post.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Travellers-waiting-for-clearance-at-the-new-bus-terminal-at-the-Beitbridge-Border-Post.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Travellers-waiting-for-clearance-at-the-new-bus-terminal-at-the-Beitbridge-Border-Post-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Travellers waiting for clearance at the new bus terminal at the Beitbridge Border Post.

The mapping exercise will be conducted in the course of February and March 2023 across all the provinces of South Africa,” read the statement. The Embassy said the second part will involve physical visits by multi-sectoral teams comprising officials from the Embassy, the Consulate and several Government ministries to designated areas across South Africa. “The online registration will entail an online registration where those who wish to be assisted are invited to register their details on that platform. “The online registration will open from February 2 to March 3.
