The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter LEADING publisher Dingani Bookshop and Stationery has donated 3 000 books worth US$15 000 to the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) Bulawayo province towards its fundraising activities to host this year’s conference. The donation was made last Friday at the Nash fundraising campaign launch held at Townsend High School. The national Conference will be held in Victoria Falls from June 20 to June 23. Nash Bulawayo province will host the conference. Just like the National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) Conference, the Nash event is an annual gathering of school heads. It provides them with an opportunity to interact and share ideas as well as discuss issues affecting the education system in the country, equip each other and share the best, and even worst experiences in the running of their respective schools. Dingani Bookshop and Stationery owner and director Witness Dingani, who presented his company’s donation said their objective is to have every secondary school learner, from the 10 000 schools in the country, having a textbook towards his or her education. “We have a wide selection of textbooks as an organisation. In our little space, we want to contribute to the nation’s vision of an educated Zimbabwean community. Our donation to the schools in Bulawayo is our signature announcement and confirmation towards that position. As Dingani Bookshop and Supplies, we are saying to the schools, education is life, ours is to make sure that it is sustained,” said Mr Dingani in a brief interview with Chronicle. He said his books are informative and entertaining and provide learners with intimate examination detail as the authors are experienced and accredited Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (Zimsec) markers.  “Ours is to give a candidate a gateway to examination success. We cover various subjects which, when one looks at it, is in sync with the Second Republic’s leaving no one and no place behind philosophy,” said Mr Dingani. Nash Bulawayo secretary and Townsend High School headmistress, Mrs Millicent Moyo hailed Dingani Bookshop and Supplies for the donation which she said would go a long way in having a successful and momentous conference. “As Nash we are delighted by what Dingani Bookshop and Supplies have done. We are excited as an organisation because it actually shows that the business community is behind us and recognises us as Nash,” said Mrs Moyo. 55 heads or their representatives attended the Friday fundraising campaign. Some of the business community that graced the event together with Dingani Bookshop and Stationery include Filmore Science and Medsup. Addressing the business delegates, Nash Bulawayo province chairperson and Mzilikazi High School headmaster, Bheki Dube said the mandate of their organisation is to liaise with the parent ministry in the furtherance of any matter that is relevant in the promotion of secondary education in the country, over and above coordinating all secondary schools sports in their entirety, including the annual Indaba. <img class="wp-image-633034 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mzilikazi-High-School.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mzilikazi-High-School.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Mzilikazi-High-School-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mzilikazi High School “It is in this light ladies and gentlemen that we invited you to this event, it is with your help as our stakeholders that we host a successful, resounding, and most memorable conference.
