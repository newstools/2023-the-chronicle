The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) says its strategic private-public partnerships (PPPs) with key institutions have started paying dividends. NRZ is going through a phased recapitalisation program to restore operational capacity and restore profitability. Recapitalisation is one of the top priorities under the National Development Strategy (NDS1) as transport and logistics are part of the key pillars of economic recovery. According to the company, several agreements are at procurement and refurbishment stages, which positions the parastatal to effectively implement its 10-year turnaround plan.  In 2021 the NRZ embarked on a restructuring exercise, which is anchored on the 10-year Strategic Plan that has three phases – the stabilisation phase, growth phase, and expansion phase. In line with Government’s Vision 2030, the strategy seeks to achieve recapitalisation, re-organisation, and transformation of NRZ into a modern and efficient mode of transport of choice for both bulk passengers and freight. Appearing before the Parliamentary Committee for Transport on Monday to deliver a report on the status of the company, NRZ general manager, Ms Respina Zinyanduko, said they have engaged several clients for partnership in refurbishing their fleet of parked wagons and locomotives through PPPs arrangements. <img class="wp-image-605607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/money-q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> USDs According to the report, 10 such arrangements have been entered into and these are at various levels of implementation.

Ms Zinyanduko said NRZ has also recorded milestones in reduction of fuel consumption. <img class="alignnone wp-image-525331 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/nrz1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/nrz1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/nrz1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “NRZ managed to reduce its locomotive fuel consumption from the then average of 1, 8 million per month to the current level of 1, 0 million average per month,” she said. “To achieve this, NRZ introduced measures to curtail fuel leakages either through theft by employees (ensured that all trains are escorted by the Loss Control and Security department, that crews are interchanged to avoid familiarity and connivance), fixed leaking fuel facilities, calibrated fuel pumps/facilities and ensured that NRZ received and dispatched correct quantities.”
