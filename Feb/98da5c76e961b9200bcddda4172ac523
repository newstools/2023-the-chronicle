The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter THE Hockey Association of Zimbabwe (HAZ) has announced a sponsorship deal with two different organisations who have come in to support the national Under-21 teams that are preparing to take part in the Africa Junior Championship in Egypt next month. HAZ got sponsorship from Ethiopian Airlines and Savvy Traveller as the date for the continental showpiece edges closer. Through their social media, the association confirmed the sponsorship from the two organisations.
“Thank you to Ethiopian Airlines. Our U21s will be flying over the African skies to the Junior Africa Cup in Egypt in March 2023.  “Thank you from the U21s to Savvytraveller for their sponsorship. Another step closer to making this dream a reality!” HAZ posted on their Facebook account.
The association has been struggling to find sponsorship to facilitate their teams’ travel to the North African nation to take part in the prestigious hockey tournament. Since the announcement of the final squads, HAZ has been appealing to individuals and corporates to help them as they try to make their dream a reality. Among other means of trying to win over sponsors to come on board, HAZ hosted exhibition matches for both their teams where they played against select teams at Saint John’s Trust Astro Turf. Both teams won their encounters 2-0.
Taking part in the tournament will give the youngsters the much-needed international experience and exposure. HAZ also promised that sponsors will be given access to breakdowns of the sponsorship expenditure as well as monthly reports from coaching staff attendance and performance of the players. The Junior Africa Cup will serve as a direct qualifier for the 2023 Junior World Cup, with the winner and runner-up qualifying. Both teams are made up of 18 members after they were cut down from the 36 who made the provisional squad a couple of months back. – @brandon_malvin
