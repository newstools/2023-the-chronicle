The Lady Chevrons star is part of the 409 players that will go under the hammer at the World Jio Convention centre in the Asian nation. Mayers said if she gets picked to take part in the inaugural event it will be a good experience for her. “I feel the Women’s Premier League (WPL) is an opportunity to play with and against the best players in the world. It’s a challenge I would love to take on as well learn from the experience and add to the team if I am picked,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-679851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mayers is ranked number 20 in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Women T20 batting rankings and she is the highest-ranked Zimbabwean female batter in the shortest version of the game with a rating of 564 points. The following player is Modester Mupachikwa in position 29 with 533 points. Having 11 players from Zimbabwe taking part in the draft, Mayers said she hope her teammates get picked as well as it will be motivation for others in the country. She added that if she gets picked it will be a huge lift for her career. “It will be a massive boost for my career but I also see it as an opportunity for younger players to keep working hard and not be afraid to put themselves out there. Hopefully, I won’t be the only Zimbabwean, there are many teammates that have registered and hopefully will be picked too,” said Mayers. In the shortest version of the match, Mayers has played 22 matches for Zimbabwe, racking up 527 runs in the process at an average of 31.0 and a strike rate of 109. 79.
