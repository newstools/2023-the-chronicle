The public will be kept abreast of all developments on the matter,” she said.

A National Civil Protection Committee emergency meeting was held yesterday in Harare where stakeholders discussed possible measures to put in place in the event of a disaster. “District Civil Protection Committees countrywide have also been mobilised and district development coordinators are required to be on standby to respond to any eventualities,” the statement added.
