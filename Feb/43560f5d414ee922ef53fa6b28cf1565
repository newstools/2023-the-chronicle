The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter THE second round of the Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB) Under-20 league was completed on Saturday at Hartsfield Rugby Grounds. This was the second week of interesting rugby action which saw three games being played on the day, with the planned women’s fixture not taking place after one of the teams did not turn up. The league, which kick-started the local rugby season started last week after an off season break. From the men’s matches played, Hornets recorded the biggest win of the day when they beat a Select side 41-0 in a match that was one-sided throughout. In the first match, Raging Bulls also proved too strong for Bulldogs, beating them 29-0. In the third match of the day, Western Suburbs won 42-13 against Old Miltonians.  Hornets and Western Suburbs have maintained a perfect start to the league having also won their opening games last week and will be looking at continuing their fine run in the league which is set to run for four weeks. As the league got underway, the board also introduced a skills development programme for all children aged between eight to 13 years old. The programme will take place every Saturday from 10am to 12pm at Hartsfield. It is free of charge and parents and schools are urged to bring in their children, both boys and girls. The province is also looking at having an invitational tournament featuring teams from Botswana in March and will be using the series to prepare for it. Last season, they managed to close the year on a high by hosting the Unforgettable Sevens Rugby Festival which was at Hartsfield as well where women, men and schools took part. More rugby festivals are expected to take place this year. The league continues on Saturday for the third week. — @brandon_malvin
