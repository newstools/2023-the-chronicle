The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Business Reporter THE Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (Arda) says prospects for a bumper maize harvest this farming season are high as most parts of the country continue to receive good rains. Zimbabwe has set a target of three million tonnes of maize this cropping season which is enough to meet its annual consumption. The Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa has made food security a top priority hence the many support schemes meant to assist farmers to boost production. <img class="wp-image-677632 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-55-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa The agriculture sector has already surpassed the US$8,2 billion agriculture industry economy target which the country intended to achieve by 2025.
