YESTERDAY, the world celebrated Kiss Day ahead of Valentine’s Day today. Cupid’s arrows will be flying around seeking to pierce hearts and create new unions or cement existing ones. To aid the god of love in his never-ending quest to forge romantic relationships, entertainment spots in Bulawayo have lined up an assortment of entertainment for patrons. The unfortunate couples will be arguing over who will be buying gifts for the other this year as others  enjoy heart-shaped boxes of chocolates, ruby-red roses and sparkling champagne among other diverse romantic gestures.  Creatives around the city told Chronicle Showbiz what they will be out to celebrate romance.
All-female Imbube ensemble Nobuntu will be hosting a show at The Oasis alongside Stango and Nongoma as well as Ramadu and Oktopus. Nobuntu’s Duduzile Sibanda said it’s all systems go for the concert. “This Valentine’s Day will be all about music to us. We are super prepared and can’t wait to perform. It’s going to be such a treat to lovers who will attend,” she said. Asked how they will balance being busy on the day when they are supposed to be enjoying quality time with their better halves, Sibanda said they will always find time for their lovers. <img class="wp-image-589455 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Valentines-Balloon-Heart.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Valentines-Balloon-Heart.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Valentines-Balloon-Heart-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Photo Credit: iStock Photo “Yes, we do have time (to spend with our spouses) as we get off days like any other employee.
