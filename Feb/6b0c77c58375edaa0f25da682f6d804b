YOUNG Sables coach Shaun de Souza says preparations for this year’s Rugby Africa Under-20 Barthes Trophy title defence are well on course. Speaking after watching some action at the Paramount Under-20 rugby competition at Old Hurrians Sports Club, De Souza said he was impressed with what he saw on exhibition. “It’s good for our Under-20 technical team because we get to see some of the talent that we have not seen,” he said.  “Our performance system is operational. When we identify players we add them into our system as we go towards the Barthes Trophy.Our fixtures are set and our first game is on 22  April. We are excited and the boys are keen so that we qualify for the Junior World Trophy. “Kenya will qualify as hosts and the winners of the Barthes Trophy are likely to be between Kenya, Zimbabwe and Namibia. We are trying to compete and defend our title. “We just have to make sure our players have their mind set on the competition,” said De Souza. <img class="wp-image-668744 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/qwqewqeee.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/qwqewqeee.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/qwqewqeee-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe national Under-20 rugby team Zimbabwe won the last edition of the Rugby Africa Under-20 Barthes Trophy after beating Namibia 19-14 in the final played at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi, Kenya in April 2022.
