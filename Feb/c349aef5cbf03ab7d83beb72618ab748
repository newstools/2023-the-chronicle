Rick Fulton, the Bonaqua Troutbeck Triathlon Africa Cup convener hailed their partnership with their sponsors and revealed that 15 countries have confirmed that they will be sending athletes for the April 1 event.
Participants who have confirmed are from Morocco, Togo, South Africa, Netherlands and Japan among other countries.  Fulton said the planning process to stage a world class event has been intense in the last six months, adding that they’ve gained momentum.
“This is the 15th year of running this event, 15 consecutive years as Africa Triathlon Cup. We’ve staged other events at Troutbeck but obviously the sequence of 15 years as a continental cup at that level is a great legacy for us. It is the longest standing event of this kind on the African continent which we’re proud of. In 2007 World Triathlon started this generation of continental cups as part of their development programmes to develop points for ranking system. “I’m very happy to inform everyone that at this moment more than 30 days away from the event we already have 25 elite athletes registered for the event, seven juniors as well. Those 25 elite athletes constitute elite men and elite women who will be racing in elite level races. They represent 15 different countries. So the start list is very good. We think we’re going to have good numbers and with 30 days before the event,” Fulton said. <img class="wp-image-684868 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/wdedgrf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/wdedgrf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/wdedgrf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Faith Nehanda, Coca-Cola Frontline Marketing Manager The competition is part of the 2024 Olympic circle qualification process, with a number of young athletes who will compete in Nyanga hoping to start their journey to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
