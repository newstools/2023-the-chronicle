The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victora Falls Reporter MATABELELAND North is still safe from the deadly Theileriosis better known as January disease as it has not recorded a single case since 2017. In an effort to maintain the status quo, the Veterinary Services Department will this Thursday launch a provincial campaign against January Disease to raise awareness among farmers. The launch will be held in Binga where Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Deputy Minister Davis Marapira will officiate. This follows the recent launch of the national campaign in Mashonaland West and comes in the wake of hundreds of cases reported in other provinces countrywide. Matabeleland North provincial veterinary officer Dr Felistas Ndlovu said the province has a strong surveillance system in both communal and commercial farming areas.  “We shall be launching the provincial “War against January Disease campaign” at Chipale dip tank in Binga on Thursday this week. Expected at the launch are Deputy Minister Marapira and other senior veterinary officers. “Historically, Theileriosis was reported almost a decade ago in the Hwange area where it was associated with buffaloes. It has not been reported in the province since the 2017 outbreak,” said Dr Ndlovu. She said despite zero prevalence, the disease remains a threat to the province hence the launch of the provincial campaign.
Theileriosis is caused by a parasite, theileria parva, which is transmitted between cattle by ticks. The disease accounts for 60 percent cattle deaths in the country thereby causing huge economic losses.
Signs of an animal affected by January disease include swelling of the lymph nodes under the ears and on the shoulder, cloudiness of the eyes and difficulty in breathing with froth from the nose and mouth. The affected animal collapses and dies within a few days. In order to control theileriosis, farmers should ensure cattle have no ticks. Matabeleland North province has more than 700 000 cattle which is a significant contribution to the national herd.
Livestock is regarded as an investment kept for food safety and nutrition, has cultural value, assists with draught power and manure. <img class="size-large wp-image-675993" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-3-copy-5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-3-copy-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-3-copy-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> File picture: A farmer examines a cow that succumbed to January disease in Fort Rixon The most common diseases in Matabeleland North include foot and mouth, blackleg, lumpy skin, among others.
Except foot and mouth disease, these diseases are prevalent during the wet season as they are vector-borne diseases, Dr Ndlovu said. She said in the province, every farming unit is under surveillance through livestock inspections, a programme that is already being rolling out at all dip tanks. Dipping of cattle is done weekly and the province has adequate acaricide to sustain the dipping.
Effective dipping is achieved when 80 percent of cattle are dipped or sprayed to prevent ticks. “Awareness campaigns are being done to educate famers on all vector-bone diseases during this time of the year and farmers are advised to regularly dip their cattle. “Cattle identification is a priority for the province as it enhances control of cattle movement, an important way of preventing spread of diseases and pests,” said Dr Ndlovu. She said farmers should keep vaccination calendars for common diseases in their areas.
Tick-borne diseases have in recent years wreaked havoc in the cattle industry and between 2015 and 2016 Theileriosis killed more than 500 000 cattle. @ncubeleo
