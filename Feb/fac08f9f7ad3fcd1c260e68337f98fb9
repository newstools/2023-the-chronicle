The Chronicle Mkhululi Ncube, Showbiz Reporter Zimbabwean gospel musician Ernest Masongela, who suffered a stroke last July, says he doubts he will ever sing or record music again. The singer, who is based in South Africa, said the stroke was a major setback in his career.
“It was on July 3, last year when I suffered a stroke. On the fateful day I spent the day on a youth outing with youths from Bellevue East Seventh Day Adventist Church. We had a good day doing nature walks, playing games, praying and rehearsing some youth choir songs as I was also the youth choir director,” said Masongela. He said at about 4.30 pm he hired a taxi home as he had left his car home.
“Just after being dropped I felt dizzy, weak and struggled to walk. My flat is about 30 metres from where I dropped off but I struggled for close to an hour to get home. My wife was shocked and wondered what was going on. I could not feel any pain but my mouth had moved to the right and my left arm and leg were numb,” said Masongela.  He said he sought medical help and did physio for about three weeks until his condition improved.
Masongela said he only managed to start walking in October and his weak left side is almost back to normal. <img class="size-large wp-image-678722" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-6-copy-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-6-copy-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-6-copy-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sizalobuhle Masukume “I really survived by God’s grace and I appreciate my fellow brethren from my church who have taken care of my welfare by paying rentals and meeting other expenses since I am not working. I’m not sure if I will ever sing again,” he said.
Masongela, who spent part of his life in Entumbane suburb, says he is still in need of financial support as he is still on medication. He said his wife, Sizalobuhle Masukume, has been a pillar of strength as she has stood with him throughout.
Masongela has eleven albums to his name and four DVDs and was also part of Harmony Sounds, a popular male group within the Seventh Day Adventist church. -@themkhust
