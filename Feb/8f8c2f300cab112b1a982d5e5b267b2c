THE funeral service for the slain Founders High School pupil, Wayne Ndlovu, will be held at his school today. The deceased was stabbed with an Okapi knife by a 17-year-old pupil from Hamilton High School in a suspected inter-school turf war on Monday. Wayne, who was aged 16 years, succumbed to the injuries upon admission to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH). He will be buried today at Umvutsha Cemetery on the outskirts of the city. Wayne’s family approached the school authorities to have the funeral service at the school.
The deceased’s father Mr Simiko Ndlovu said he was humbled when the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education acceded to his request . <img class="size-large wp-image-681453" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gbgfv-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gbgfv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gbgfv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Founders High School learners He said conducting the service at the school will help bring closure to other learners who were traumatised following the death of their colleague. “We requested that the funeral service be held at Founders High School and I’m humbled that the Ministry acceded to the request. We will be starting the funeral service at 8.30AM after which we proceed to Umvutsha where he will be laid to rest,” said Mr Ndlovu.  He said he hoped after the service, pupils from both schools will appreciate the undesirable consequences of violence.
Mr Ndlovu said society needs to confront the challenge of gang fights between pupils from different schools. He said the post-mortem report stated that his son died from excessive bleeding after the knife damaged his right jugular vein.
Primary and Secondary Education communications and advocacy director Mr Taungana Ndoro said the ministry shared the Ndlovu family’s view that violence among pupils needs to be dealt with. “We really considered their request and accepted. We believe conducting the service at the school might serve a platform to educate our pupils, parents and society as a whole on the dangers of engaging in violence,” he said.
