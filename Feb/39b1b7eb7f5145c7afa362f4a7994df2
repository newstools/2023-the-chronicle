IT was an occasion of immense poignancy at Josiah Tungamirai Airbase in Gweru as two caskets swathed in the national flag and mounted on trolleys were gently pushed by pallbearers into the Parade Square. The caskets contained the remains of two senior Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) pilots, Josiah Tungamirai Air Force Base deputy commander, Group Captain Bensen Munyanduki (50) and Wing Commander Daniel Manyenga (37) who died last Thursday. The two senior officers were killed when an AFZ SF260, trainer aircraft, crashed in the Mlezu College general area, near Kwekwe. <img class="wp-image-679368 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/yhhjkihghg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/yhhjkihghg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/yhhjkihghg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> AFZ chief of staff, supporting services, Air Vice Marshal Jacob Nzwede, lays a wreath on Josiah Tungamirai Airforce Base deputy commander Group Captain Bensen Manyanduki’s casket yesterday The aircraft was on a routine training sortie when it hit a power line and crashed. As a sign of respect and honour for the two fallen pilots, everyone on the parade square stood at attention. Each casket accompanied by a chaplain had a six-man guard of honour carrying the coffins to the parade square. As per tradition, the firing party with the Air Force Brass Band joined the march in the square as they played the moving beautiful renditions of “Baba Ndiri Mwana Wenyu” (Father, I am your child) and “Apo Mambo Ouya” (When the King Shall Come Again). At about 10.15AM, the two caskets were paraded in the square as relatives, friends and workmates took their seats.  Closely following the proceedings were AFZ Commander Air Marshal Elson Moyo, Midlands Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Larry Mavima, the permanent secretary in the province, Mr Abiot Maronge, and Josiah Tungamirai Air Force Base Commander, Air Commodore Marcelino Jakuvos Jaya, among others. As the sun beat relentlessly down on the parade square, the procession stood at ease as the presiding officer, AFZ Chief-of-Staff Air Vice Marshal Jacob Nzwede and supporting services took over the funeral parade. Air Vice Marshal Nzwede read the obituaries of the fallen pilots before the parade marched past Air Marshal Moyo. However, due to the state of the bodies, there was no body viewing. It was a moving moment as the caskets were taken to two hearses with some relatives and friends failing to control their emotions as the deceased were now being taken to their final resting places. <img class="alignnone wp-image-679139 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/3-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/3-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/3-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Both the Munyanduki and Manyenga families and friends also took time to comfort each other through handshakes and warm embraces.

Group Captain Munyanduki was laid to rest yesterday at Destiny Cemetery in Gweru while Wing Commander Manyenga will be buried today at his rural home in Gutu, Masvingo Province. Air Vice Marshal Nzwede, who was the chief mourner, said he was shocked and saddened when he learnt of the death of the two pilots. “They were taken away from us at the time when their services were critically required in the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and the Air Force of Zimbabwe in particular,” said Air Vice Marshal Nzwede. <img class="wp-image-679131 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/2-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/2-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/2-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Funeral parade He said Group Captain Munyanduki attended three primary schools in Chimanimani, Chipinge and Beitbridge between 1981 and 1984. “For his secondary education, he attended Nyanga High School and completed his Advanced level at Fletcher High School in Gweru in 1992.
