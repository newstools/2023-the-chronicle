The Chronicle Flora Fadzai Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter GOVERNMENT’S policy of fostering private-public partnerships is transforming Bulawayo as it has seen more private schools being built in the city to help decongest public schools. Most Government schools have high enrollments and inadequate infrastructure to cater for all learners.
According to the Zimbabwe Education Analysis 2016-2020 Report in Zimbabwe, there are not enough schools in the country to match the pupil population. The report says there is a need to build 4 500 new schools while adding that at existing schools, classes are too big therefore about 40 000 more classrooms are needed. This led to Government inviting the private sector to come forward and build new schools which will help decongest the ones already available.
Bulawayo is one of the provinces which has seen more private schools being built to complement the Government.  A Chronicle news crew spoke to residents around the city who appreciated what private players are doing to help decongest schools, especially in suburbs such as Cowdray Park that had little development taking place.
Some residents however said the fees at most of the private schools were exorbitant, deferring Government’s endeavor to decongest the already available schools. Mr Emanuel Dlodlo from Cowdray Park, Empompini, said the gesture by Government was appreciated especially in their area where there was no Government high school easily accessible to children.
He said the newly built V A Mhlophe High Shool had reduced transport costs for parents as there is now a school nearby. “We have two private schools in our area now. A high school and a primary school. We are really grateful that we now have our own schools which are close to our homes. One can feel safe knowing their child is not travelling all the way to town every day,” said Mr Dlodlo.
A woman who only identified herself as Mrs Dube said despite getting the new schools, the fees are a bit high and they still find it hard to send their children to the private schools. She said although the education is good and they have good extracurricular activities, the schools should try and reduce their fees to accommodate people from different income brackets.
“The private high school costs over US$300 this term. Not forgetting one has to buy uniforms and tracksuits and pay for all the other activities that are being done there. We hope the Government tries to negotiate with the private schools so that fees are reduced,” said Mrs Dube. <img class="wp-image-675701 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-52-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-52-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-52-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education spokesperson Mr Taungana Ndoro Ms Sihle Bhebhe from Nkulumane said private schools are giving children from high density areas a chance to get the best education while also uplifting their suburbs.
She said children from low density suburbs now travel all the way from their homes to high density areas just to access education. “Despite the high fees that people pay at private schools, I would highly recommend them because they are less decongested and that makes it easier for most teachers to concentrate on each pupil,” said Ms Bhebhe.
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education spokesperson Mr Taungana Ndoro said the coming in of private schools has helped the Government in providing high quality education and meeting the challenges that are faced at Government schools. He said at the moment, private players are providing the best education.
“The Government is in full support of this, that is why in a recent stakeholder’s meeting, the Minister of Education called upon private players to come forward so that through partnerships, Vision 2030 and a prosperous education system can be achieved,” said Mr Ndoro. – @flora_sibanda
