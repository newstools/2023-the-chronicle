After winning the title coming from having been through Zimbabwean structures, Zimbabwe Golf Association (ZGA) president Martin Chikwana said it speaks to the importance of having good structures at junior level. “It’s one of those things that helps you realise the importance of structures like junior golf development and the pathways in which ZGA plays a part in creating to enable those youngsters to flourish. We don’t normally play a big part when it comes to wins like this because these youngsters put in a lot of hard work to get to where they are and they have management teams that ensures that everything they need is provided for and of course parents who offer a very significant part in ensuring that these guys go out and perform week in and week out. “Benjamin is one amongst the few that has gone through our pathways and you have seen Robson Chinhoi who has been doing wonders on the Safari Tours in Kenya where he has been winning left right and centre and of course we have our number one golfer in the country Scott Vincent who has also been raising the flag and underneath those guys. <img class="wp-image-678967 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ereftt.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ereftt.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ereftt-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benjamin Follet-Smith playing a shot They have gone through under the development programs run by ZGA so we are quite humbled and yet we are quick to realise that we only provide pathways, the rest which is the bigger chunk is provided for by all those partnerships that I have mentioned (parents, management teams),” said Chikwana.
Follet-Smith was followed by Ugo Coussaud from France and South Africa’s Jaco Van Zyl who were tied on -14 under par. — @brandon_malvin
