The Chronicle Rapper Nadia Nakai posted an emotional tribute in honour of her late boyfriend Kiernan Forbes, popularly known as AKA. Sunday was the first time that Nakai had spoken out on social media since her tragic loss. “My heart is shattered, this is not what our future was meant to look like. I can’t believe I said my final goodbye to you yesterday,” she said in the post. Nakai said AKA prayed for, protected and inspired her. “I find it hard to breathe, let alone find the words to explain how much I love you. I’m really going to miss all the special moments we’ve had. This really hurts!” The 32-year-old said that she was struggling to come to terms with what had happened. “There is no pain bigger than the pain of losing you. I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with you. I realise you’re the one who spent the rest of your life with me.” AKA, along with his friend and former manager, Tebello ‘Tibz’ Motsoane, were shot and killed by unknown gunmen on 10 February as they were leaving Wish restaurant along Durban’s famous Florida Road. The pair were buried in separate private funerals over the weekend. -ewn/eyewitness
