Government says it has relaxed regulations on marketing of agricultural produce like maize in response to increased productivity. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Minister Dr Anxious Masuka said starting this cropping season, self-contracted farmers will be allowed to sell their maize with little restrictions from Government. He was speaking in Victoria Falls recently after attending the official listing of diversified group Innscor Africa Limited on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange.  Dr Masuka said opening up markets, however, doesn’t mean removing controls completely as regulations remain necessary. He said Government’s focus is to ensure that there is production and productivity which brings viability. “You can’t market where there is no production. When there is production and productivity, then you will free up the market. Where we are coming from is that in the past 20 years we have not been able to produce enough maize to feed ourselves but the situation changed during the past few seasons as we managed to produce enough. What we are doing now is we are now gradually reviewing the Statutory Instrument 145 of 2019, which restricted the marketing of maize to Grain Marketing Board and from this marketing season onwards, anyone who has contracted will be able to freely get their contracted maize to their warehouse,” said Dr Masuka. He said Government will have less role in the marketing of maize to companies that have contracted farmers. <img class="wp-image-671403 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/download.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/download.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/download-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Innscor Africa Limited Dr Masuka said Government has put in place the Warehouse Receipt Act and Commodity Exchange Act making it easier for farmers to sell their produce to registered dealers. “Farmers are now able to trade their produce and this gradual opening up is in response to increased production and productivity. I however believe some regulations are necessary if we are to grow the agricultural sector,” said Dr Masuka. He said governments the world over will always intervene to ensure basic commodities remain affordable to majority of citizens. – @ncubeleon.
