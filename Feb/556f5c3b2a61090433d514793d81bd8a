The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MARVELOUS Nakamba managed to seal a deal away from English Premier League club Aston Villa on deadline day after completing a loan move to English Championship side Luton Town yesterday. The Zimbabwean midfielder is joining Luton Town on loan for the remainder of the season. He had his medical yesterday morning before his move was confirmed later in the day. Nakamba was forced to move after he was told by Aston Villa coach Unai Emery he was not in his plans. Villa have also let go of Cameron Archer and Morgan Sanson on loan. “Aston Villa can confirm Bertrand Traoré has been recalled from his loan spell at Istanbul Basaksehir. “Also, we are wishing the best to @Nakamba_11, who has joined Luton Town on loan, and @AaronRamseyx, who has joined Middlesbrough on loan, both for the rest of the season,” posted Aston Villa last night.  Before his loan move to Luton Town, Nakamba had made a single Premier League appearance this season and will enter the final 12 months of his Villa deal in the summer after first joining the club back in 2019. The 29-year-old’s last appearance for Villa came against Manchester City in the final day of the 2021/22 season as he didn’t feature in any of the club’s cup games this season either. He is yet to score a goal for Villa but played his part in the club’s bid for survival in 2019/20 and also started in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley that year against City. The midfielder made 58 EPL appearances since joining the Claret and Blue, 29 coming in his maiden season at Villa Park. He followed that up with 13 appearances the next season but has had to grapple with a series of injuries and loss of form. Nakamba was a key figure in the early days of Steven Gerrard’s reign but a knee injury in December 2021 impacted heavily on his progress. The Zimbabwe Warriors midfield genius who had fallen out of favour with previous managers Dean Smith, Gerrard and his interim successor Aaron Danks, still found it difficult to get game time under Emery, leading to him being sent out on loan. <img class="wp-image-565609 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Dean-Smith.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Dean-Smith.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Dean-Smith-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Aston Villa manager Dean Smith issues instructions during the Premier League match between Aston Villa and Brentford at Villa Park Luton Town were seventh on the English Championship before taking on Cardiff City last night.
