The Chronicle THE start of Paris Saint-Germain’s training session this morning – which was partially open to the press – notably saw Kylian Mbappé make his return to action, having ostensibly mostly recovered from a thigh injury. The Frenchman was initially scheduled to miss the last 16 clash against Bayern Munich tomorrow after picking up the injury in a win against Montpellier at the start of the month, and was set to be back within three weeks.  Lionel Messi had sustained a hamstring issue in the Coupe de France defeat to Marseille, which saw him miss the trip down to Monaco this weekend. As was indicated last week, the Argentine has also made his return to full training – PSG looking to beat the odds and face the Bundesliga champions with their star attacking trio. <img class="alignnone wp-image-424073 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/PSG.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/PSG.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/PSG-360x206.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Equally as crucial for the Parisians will be Marco Verratti’s return to training, the Italian midfielder having been absent first through suspension, and then as a result of a minor injury that saw him miss the match against the Principality side. — GFNF
