The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SEVENTEEN-Year-Old Highlanders Football Club attacking midfielder Prince Ndlovu might have lost the opportunity to travel to Croatia for trials after being denied a visa, but hope is not lost for the youngster as plans are underway to get him another European break. Ndlovu was supposed to go for a month-long trial stint at Croatian second tier club HNK Vukovar 1991 alongside Majesa Academy’s attacking midfielder Promise Sithole. The trial stint was supposed to start on February 10 and end on March 9.
Marvelous Nakamba Foundation (MNF) were facilitators for the rising stars to embark on a trip to Croatia as part of the promise that they made when they held inaugural Under-17 tournament in Bulawayo last year. <img class="wp-image-620701 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-404.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-404.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-404-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marvelous Nakamba Foundation (MNF) Invitational Under-17 tournament Nduduzo Sibanda, MNF director of projects and operations said after hitting a snag at the Croatian embassy, they are exploring other avenues so that they honour their pledge of giving opportunities to youngsters.
“It’s unfortunate that the Croatian opportunity for Prince Ndlovu and Promise Sithole didn’t materialise due to circumstances beyond our control, but as the Marvelous Nakamba Foundation we’re working on securing prospects for the boys elsewhere in Europe. MNF is committed to inspiring youngsters and creating opportunities for young talent to explore. “We are confident that we will manage to secure opportunities for Prince and Promise as we fulfil the promise we made to the boys after the MNF Under-17 tournament,” said Sibanda.  After last year’s tournament that was won by Mutare’s Majesa Academy, MNF chairperson Antony Nakamba said the duo was supposed to go to Turkey for a two-week stint in December, before they eventually managed to get invitations from HNK Vukovar 1991. In his speech to the participants, Nakamba senior spoke about the importance of dedication and fighting spirit in football and challenged the youngsters to shun drugs and concentrate on football as well as their education.
Ndlovu, who made his debut for Highlanders’ senior team in July last year following his promotion from the club’s developmental side Bosso-90, spent two weeks training at Orlando Pirates while waiting for the Croatian visa. <img class="wp-image-631120 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-24-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-24-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-24-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso chief executive officer Ronald Moyo The Makokoba bred footballer has returned to Bosso and played in their two preseason matches against Premiership newboys Sheasham and First Division side Dulivhadzimu of Beitbridge.
