The Chronicle Matthew 5:13-16
13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. (NKJV) I AM always embarrassed by a child of God who is sat down by a heathen and taught about prophecy other spiritual topics. Where is your saltiness? Where is your anointing? We are supposed to transform the world, we are the ones to answer them gently, sit them down, and enlighten them by preaching the Word of God. The Problem Is That the Church Now Conforms to The World. <img class="size-large wp-image-603235" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Reading-Bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bible- Image taken from Shutterstock The reason why the church is conforming to the world is because the church is now lukewarm. When the church sees a man preaching the gospel in the streets, they think that he has lost his mind. The Christianity which we are now living in is a Christianity of being confined in a church building, we are no longer out to tell people about Jesus like before. Jesus never spent too much time in Synagogues, but many times he was out transforming people, he had one statement that he would proclaim, “the zeal of the house of God is eating me up.” Meaning that He was boiling with the power of God, with the things of God.  Luke 4:18
The Spirit of the Lord (is) upon Me, because He has anointed Me (the Anointed One, the Messiah) to preach the good news (the Gospel) to the poor; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [who are downtrodden, bruised, crushed, and broken down by calamity], AMP He could not sit and let the world take over, the zeal of God prompted Him to go out and strive to spread the Word of God.
The devil now wants to manage the church using the newspaper articles for instance in the area of giving tithes and offerings. Such articles must be managed by the church, the church must be the ones to write articles about offering, not to sit back and let non-believers preach about what they do not know. We have a better understanding of these things, after all, the Bible says silver and gold belongs to God.
