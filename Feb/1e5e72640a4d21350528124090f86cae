BULAWAYO province is hosting the senior national swimming championships from today to Monday next week at the Bulawayo City Pool. This will be the first event to be hosted in the City of Kings and Queens post Covid-19 restrictions after last year’s competition was hosted by Harare. A total of 275 swimmers from across the country are expected to take part in the championships. Zimbabwe Swimming chairperson Zanele Nkomazana said hosting the event will boost the city’s business.  “Zimbabwe Swimming gives all provinces with facilities hosting rights. Bulawayo has the best facility in the country and really this should boost the city’s business for the week. We have lots of both up and coming and senior swimmers from all provinces, from 10 years to masters swimmers, it will be a great competition for all,” she said. Of the swimmers coming in to participate at the event, Harare will have 153 participants, Bulawayo 66, Matabeleland South has 40 while Mashonaland districts will have 40 as well and Matabeleland North, Manicaland and Midlands will have just under 10 swimmers. Masvingo will not attend as they could not raise a team. Bulawayo Amateur Swimming Association (BASA) chairperson Phawulani Ngwenya said hosting the nationals is a big boost for the people and city. <img class="wp-image-482579 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/swimming-tracks.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/swimming-tracks.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/swimming-tracks-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Swimming pool “It’s a big boost to be honest, it’s a massive boost because it is the development it brings to host, that for example there is a lot of work that has gone through the ablution facilities, we just finished working on the parking area on the small pool, we have compacted the whole area, it has been cleared and all debris removed, water channels cleared which is a big boost for the city of Bulawayo and for the people,” said Ngwenya. He added that preparations for the event have gone well and Bulawayo athletes will have to use home advantage to excel. “The preparations, the intensity, being the hosting province means that they have to perform at their highest level. It comes with a bit of pressure but it also comes with pride that you are on home ground so you have to really perform at your highest levels,” he said.  Some of the athletes to look forward to in the competition from Bulawayo are 17-year old Jayden de Swaart who has come in very strong over the last two seasons who has qualified for the South Africa Grand Prix and  Tichatonga Makaya, the 100m butterfly record holder in Zimbabwe at a time of 59, 97 seconds. Onesimus Ngwenya, a strong Under-16 swimmer and Sibusiso Fayayo, a  grade seven pupil at Masiyephambili Junior School are some of the swimmers to look out for. On the girls’ side, Senamile Mphoko is tipped to do very well while the girls captain Riana Rollo is expected to retain the girls’ 17 and over championship. On the 16 years age group there is Khaya Vimba who is a strong breaststroker and will be looking forward to dropping her time from about 1.11 to about 1.10. From Matabeleland South, Andile Mhlope and Tawanda Chisungo both learners at Falcon College prepared for the championships by taking part in a training camp in Mpumalanga, South Africa last month. After the national championships, over 22 swimmers are expected to take part in the Level Twos event at Hillcrest Swimming Pool, then towards the end of March the Level Threes comprising 28 swimmers will travel to KZN.
Ngwenya said these championships give them (athletes) the platform to improve their times and rankings. The South Africa National Junior Tour  will be held at the end of April where Zimbabwe will send over 20 swimmers, eight of them from Bulawayo. Another 13 swimmers will take part in the South Africa National Championships and three are from Bulawayo.
“So, a lot of pressure but good pressure and we are really excited about that,” said Ngwenya. – @brandon_malvin
