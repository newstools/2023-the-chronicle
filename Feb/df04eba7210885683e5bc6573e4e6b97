THE Holy Cross Dam wall in Mberengwa District in the Midlands Province which collapsed in 2007 is now being reconstructed. The dam has a catchment area of 158 square kilometres and will service Holy Cross Mission, local schools, hospital and the business centre. The completion of the dam will result in the resuscitation of irrigation schemes that will benefit five wards. <img class="alignnone wp-image-684953 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ddfgfghhhj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ddfgfghhhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ddfgfghhhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Construction of the dam came to a halt in 2007 due to financial challenges.
In an interview, Zanu-PF Chirumhanzu legislator Cde Babra Rwodzi said: “Finally the Holy Cross dam wall that collapsed in 2007 is now under reconstruction and villagers and the community at large are very excited about this project.”  She said the project is expected to be completed in July this year. “As we speak works on site have started, with machinery on site,” said Cde Rwodzi, who is also the Deputy Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry. “Our main objective is to resuscitate the irrigation scheme that will see communities from five surrounding wards benefiting from the scheme. We are an agro-based constituency with three operational irrigation schemes namely Hama-Mavhaire, Mhende and Siyaso.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-684871 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/4trwerwr.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/4trwerwr.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/4trwerwr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Horticulture, she said, is one of the thrusts under the National Development Strategy (NDS 1) development projects. NDS1 will help in the revival of horticultural production with a focus on exports as well as improved household nutrition. The strategy is being implemented under the Zimbabwe Horticulture Recovery and Growth Plan. <img class="alignnone wp-image-684884 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gghhtgtgfghhj.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gghhtgtgfghhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gghhtgtgfghhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Hence restoration of our water sources in the constituency is fundamental as outlined by President Mnangagwa in Vision 2030 of an Upper to Middle Income Economy for Zimbabwe,” said Cde Rwodzi. “Access to irrigation can also help improve communities’ water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and support communities’ health status.”
