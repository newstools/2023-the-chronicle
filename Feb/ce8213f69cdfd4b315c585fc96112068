The Chronicle Sports Reporter ZIFA Southern Region teams held their Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) at Raylton Sports Club yesterday despite being advised by the national association not to hold the meeting. The clubs however, said holding the meeting was not an act of defiance as communication from the national body came at the eleventh hour making it difficult to cancel the meeting. Zifa Southern Region spokesperson Blessing Mbwanda said some clubs learnt of the Zifa notice sent on Saturday yesterday morning. “As clubs we recognise the leadership of the Gift Banda led executive. Our holding of the meeting was not an act of defiance but communication came in late. Some only saw the notice on social media when preparations for the meeting had already been done. Those coming from outside Bulawayo had already been paid for accommodation and transport so we could not cancel the meeting,” said Mbwanda.  Eighteen of the 23 expected teams attended the meeting including Zifa Matebeleland North province. The attendees included newly promoted sides . Bosso 90, BCC and ZPC Hwange were absent while they were excuses from Khami and Binga Pirates. Zifa said it had appointed Barbara Chikosi to lead a task force that will seek to end the impasse at the Zifa Southern Region office. Late last year, Southern Region clubs refused to extend the term of chairman Andrew Tapela, his deputy Gaylord Madhunguza as well as secretary Mehluli Thebe which ended in October. A total of 12 out of the 17 clubs attended the meeting at the Zifa Southern Region offices in Bulawayo and agreed to boot out Tapela, Madhunguza and Thebe. Board member finance Tizirayi Luphahla survived the axe. <img class="wp-image-442525 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Binga-Pirates.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Binga-Pirates.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Binga-Pirates-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Binga Pirates “We do accept the decision by the Zifa national to send in a taskforce to deal with the situation we have as a region. When the taskforce comes we will be ready for them and we will fully cooperate. In the meantime work has to continue,” said Mbwanda. Mbwanda said the aim of the Sunday meeting was only to map a way forward for the region. “Look, there is no way you can start a season without holding a meeting. This meeting was only meant to map a way forward for the region. Clubs had some issues that they wanted sorted before football begins. There were issues with referees fees, sponsorship amongst other issues which we discussed and agreed on. The National League was discussed and some clubs are showing interest. Luphahla also presented his finance report. Clubs were also happy that they received funding from Zifa national,” he said.— -@innocentskizoe
