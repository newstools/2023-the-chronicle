THE new plant and animal quarantine, which is part of the US$300 million Beitbridge Border Post modernisation project, is now complete and ready for operationalisation as the Second Republic steps up efforts to complete key projects. The facility is set to decongest Beitbridge Border Post and enhance the country’s capacity to control export and import of related products. <img class="wp-image-679326 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fffhhh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fffhhh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fffhhh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The new animal and plant quarantine facility in Beibridge Located about 5km north of the Beitbridge Border Post, the plant and animal quarantine centre is one of the key projects that the Government in partnership with the ZimBorders Consortium is constructing under the border modernisation initiative. The border modernisation project is being done on a 17-and-a-half-year concession, which will see the consortium managing the facility for that period and retaining its investments from toll fees. Afterwards, the facility will be handed over to the Government. Some off-port works include the construction of 220 staff houses, a fire station, a 14, 5 mega litres water reservoir, sewer oxidation dam and road upgrade.  Prior to the construction of the plant and animal quarantine centre, services were being offered within the border area albeit under limited space. The animal and plant quarantine centre is one of the key projects under the border modernisation programme that is set for completion at the end of June. The facility houses laboratories for animal health, general hazards, and farming-related equipment.
Some of the laboratories will be managed by the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), Veterinary Services, Agriculture Plant, and the National Biotechnology Authority (NBA). ZimBorders’ chief executive officer, Mr Francois Diedrechsen said they have since handed over the facility to the Government. <img class="wp-image-626527 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-60-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environmental Management Agency (EMA) “We have completed the animal and plant quarantine facility and handed it to the Government. We understand they are now working on the necessary process to operationalise it,” he said. “In addition, we have completed the in-port works which include the construction of three terminals to handle freight, buses, light vehicles and passenger traffic, and what is now left are ancillary works”. <img class="alignnone wp-image-679327 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/kllmjnbhv.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/kllmjnbhv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/kllmjnbhv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Diedrechsen said they expect to hand over the water reservoir and the 220 housing units to the Government at the end of March. Beitbridge’s health and plant inspector-in-charge, Mr Levy Gama said the new facility will improve efficiencies considering that all laboratory analysis will be done on the spot. <img class="wp-image-615225 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-41-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZimBorders chief executive officer, Mr Francois Diedrechsen He said they were sending samples to other urban areas, especially Harare, which was time-consuming. “This is a welcome development that will enhance the ease of doing business. The facility has laboratories and incinerators for us to do the laboratory analysis and to destroy rejected products,” said Mr Gama. <img class="alignnone wp-image-679330 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ggbjnmkn.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ggbjnmkn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/ggbjnmkn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “In addition, this is good for citrus and horticulture farmers since we will be able to do all the necessary checks for exports and imported raw materials closer to them.” — @tupeyo
