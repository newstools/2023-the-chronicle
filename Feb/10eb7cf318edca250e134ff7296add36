The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent POLICE in the Midlands Province have said there is an increase in cases of passengers being robbed by unregistered private taxi operators. Members of the public have since been urged to use registered public transport. Midlands Police Spokesperson, Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said two Gweru siblings fell victim to a gang of armed robbers who had offered them a lift from Riverside suburb to Gweru’s city centre. The two sisters, Faith Mangwana (42) and Prisca Marindire (41), lost about US$290 and other valuables to the robbers. <img class="alignnone wp-image-583172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/money56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We are investigating a robbery case which occurred in Gweru along Mvuma Road near Riverside on February 19, 2023 around 5AM when two sisters boarded an unregistered Toyota Wish vehicle which had four male occupants,” said Inspector Mahoko. Along the way, two of the occupants produced knives and ordered the women to surrender cash and cellphones.  “Upon reaching a railway line, the driver stopped the vehicle and two men produced knives threatening the women with death if they did not surrender their valuables. “They took US$290 and ZW$4000 cash, cellphones as well as a bag containing clothing items before throwing them out and speeding off,” said Inspector Mahoko. In a related incident, which occurred on the same date at around the same time, a man was robbed of US$1 000 after boarding an unregistered Toyota Wish. “Demezela Chandiya (24) boarded a Toyota Wish which had four occupants intending to go to Mkoba. Along the way, the driver of the vehicle stopped and two occupants produced knives threatening to stab him if he did not produce valuables,” said Inspector Mahoko. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-482836" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/kitchen-knife-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/kitchen-knife-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/kitchen-knife.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> The suspects reportedly blindfolded the complainant until they reached MASO turn-off in Mkoba where they pushed him out of the vehicle and sped off. He lost US$1000 and a cellphone to the robbers. Police said such cases are on the increase and urged members of the public to avoid boarding unregistered private vehicles. “We are appealing to all commuters to make use of available public transport and avoid boarding private and unregistered vehicles as they will risk falling victim to muggings,” said Insp Mahoko.
