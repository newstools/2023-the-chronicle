The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter NOVEMBER will mark five years since former Zimbabwe wicketkeeper Peter Joseph Moor last played Test cricket for his country of birth and in April he will be donning the traditional whites once again. However, it will not be the whites for Zimbabwe but Ireland after he was named to the Test team that will play against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The 32-year-old former Chevrons wicketkeeper, who holds an Irish passport, will once again return to the international setup after he played for the Ireland Development XI. He is set to become the second Zimbabwean cricketer to play a Test for two different countries after Gary Ballance who made his debut for the country of his birth last week having switched allegiance from England last year.  Moor, who is part of the Mega Market Mountaineers side that is sitting in second position in the ongoing 2022/23 Logan Cup season, played four Tests for Zimbabwe between 2016 and 2018 scoring 533 runs at an average of 35,53. Ireland head coach, Heinrich Malan believes Moor’s experience will come in handy for his inexperienced side. He is one of the 10 players in the 15-member squad that have never played a Test for Ireland. <img class="wp-image-679323 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/klpqadggbb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/klpqadggbb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/klpqadggbb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gary Ballance raises his bat after reaching 50 “He (Moor) played a bit of Test cricket in Bangladesh and gives us some experience in that middle order. He brings that to the party. It’s nice to have someone in the wings that could come in with a bit of experience, with relevant information on what it’s like to just bolster that experience side of things as well. “He will be one of those 10 guys, which I mentioned earlier that haven’t played for Ireland yet. He has played international cricket and it’s nice to have someone with that calibre in and around our environment,” said Malan. Moor’s last international match was a T20 match when Zimbabwe played against Singapore in October 2019 in a tri-series. He was voted player of the match after a brilliant 92 runs not out coming off just 60 deliveries. The Chevrons won the match by eight wickets. In the Logan Cup, Moor has played five matches and scored 217 runs with a high score of 89 and an average of 31. The Tests for Ireland are scheduled to take place from 4-8 April against Bangladesh and 18-22 against Sri Lanka. @brandon_malvin
