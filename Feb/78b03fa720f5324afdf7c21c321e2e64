The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief ABOUT 100 households in Ward 20 in Bulilima now have access to tap water from a solar powered borehole thanks to a Government programme which seeks to provide clean and safe water to 35 000 villages in the country. Under the programme, Government is drilling boreholes in different villages across the country and Bulilima villagers have since benefited. Some of the boreholes are solar powered. Early last month Government working with its development partners installed a solar powered borehole in Male Village that enables villagers to access tap water. Gogo Sikelela Ndebele from Male Village said water problems are now a thing of the past. “Collecting water used to be a huge burden especially for someone like me who has become of age. We used to go to the river which is about five kilometres to collect water. Coming back with a bucket full of water was a great challenge especially for me,” she said. “We used to drink dam water but we were always scared that it would cause health problems. I think some of the sicknesses that we experienced were a result of the unclean water that we were drinking. We used to drink from the same water point as livestock. This is the water that we were also giving the children. The intervention from Government has come as a huge relief for us because I can now walk a few metres to the borehole and collect my water without much labour.” Another villager, Ms Phumuzile Moyo said collecting water from the river used to take up much of their time as women and now they have time to do other household chores. Ms Moyo said it is their first time to have access to tap water in their community. She said now that they have a reliable source of income they will be able to start garden projects. Ward 20 councillor, Benjamin Nleya said in his ward Male and Tjompani villages have benefited under the programme. He said a solar powered borehole has also been drilled at Tjompani Village and taps will be installed so that the community can start accessing clean water. “This move by Government has brought much relief to the Male community. Another borehole has been drilled in Tjompani Village and we are awaiting installation of taps so that the community can start accessing clean water. Solar powered boreholes are ideal in our area considering that it’s a dry place. Authorities have indicated that another solar powered borehole will be drilled at Male Primary School which is experiencing serious water challenges,” he said. Bulilima West legislator who is also Information, Communication, Technology, Postal and Courier Services Dingumuzi Phuthi said Government’s programme of drilling boreholes is ongoing in the district. <img class="wp-image-590907 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-6-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Untitled-6-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Information Communication Technology Postal and Courier Services Deputy Minister, Dingumuzi Phuthi He said Government has introduced solar powered boreholes as part of its rural industrialisation drive. He said more villages are yet to benefit as Government wants to ensure that no one and no place is left behind in its development agenda. Cde Phuthi said the programme has seen former marginalised communities being uplifted. “This district is generally dry which was making it difficult for villagers to access water. We thank Government as a number of villagers now have boreholes in the district. In addition to that, Government is also installing solar powered boreholes. The communities do not only have water but they can get it from taps. This programme is ongoing and more villages are set to benefit. Government will continue investing in water infrastructure development in order to mitigate the effects climate change,” he said.  Development of water infrastructure is one of the key pillars under NDS1 which in turn will culminate in the attainment of Vision 2030. Government is rollling out a rural industrialisation programme where it will provide clean and safe water to 35 000 villages in the country. – @DubeMatutu
