The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief The brick moulding business has changed Mr Henry Chisaku’s life and the lives of 46 other people he employs. In 1988, his father started a brick moulding business and by then, Mr Chisaku was at school before he started buying and selling in Namibia. Mr Chisaku then took over and registered the company as FC Bricks in 2017. The company produces between 17 000 and 21 000 standard bricks and 1 300 blocks per day and all the bricks are machine compressed. <img class="wp-image-534632 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/bricks.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/bricks.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/bricks-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bricks FC Bricks now has three branches in Gweru, located in the Heavy Industrial Site, Daylesford and Claremont. Mr Chisaku now employs 46 people, including office attendants, drivers and a production team. This reporter met with him at his Heavy Industrial Site branch where he was busy assisting his employees to mould some bricks. The branch is a hive of activity as there are two lorries branded “FC Bricks” that are being loaded with standard bricks set for delivery to customers. On one end are brick moulders mixing sand, cement, and water before putting them onto the brick moulding machine, kick-starting the manufacturing process.  There are also tonnes of sand, cement and huge containers filled with water in the yard, which are always stocked up so that production is not disrupted. On the other end, are standard bricks that are drying up while other piles have already dried up and are ready for delivery. “It is a busy day today because I have orders that need to be delivered in Mvuma by tomorrow. We produce between 17 000 and 21 000 standard bricks and 1 300 blocks per day and all the bricks are machine compressed,” he said while removing the gloves he was wearing. Mr Chisaku said the construction industry is growing rapidly, a development he attributed to the growth of the brick moulding industry. Housing delivery is one of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) pillars. The key drive, therefore, is to address the inadequacies pertaining to infrastructure and provide citizens with access to affordable and quality settlements in the country. The country is facing a national housing backlog of 1,5 million housing units and the Government is spearheading housing delivery through the construction of houses and flats for civil servants. Councils and private players are also part of the process as they sell stands, a development that has seen a housing development boom across the country. Mr Chisaku said he is a player in the development of the country by supplying bricks that are needed in the construction industry. “I believe we are playing a huge role by supplying bricks to potential homeowners who are busy constructing houses and even commercial buildings. The country is experiencing a massive boom in housing construction spearheaded by the Government and private developers and we are there to supply bricks which has resulted in the growth of this business,” he said. Mr Chisaku, who once joined the great trek to the United Kingdom where he stayed for eight years before returning home, said the country has a conducive environment for business to grow. “We thank the Government that is giving us the opportunity to work. The construction industry is growing under this Government and people can buy stands and start construction even before they finish paying them off,” he said. Mr Chisaku said as the economy is growing, there is need for new and efficient brick moulding equipment. “We are asking for access to affordable financing so that we get brick moulding machines and move with the times. We want to improve on machinery from China which are fast, efficient and effective,” he said. Mr Chisaku said in the near future, he is planning on opening new branches in other towns and cities. “We plan to open branches in Kwekwe and Shurugwi; right now we are supplying bricks to customers as far as Mvuma. We are also working on making red bricks. You find customers in Gweru are buying them from Harare and Bulawayo. So we have seen a potential market and we want to supply these types of bricks,” he said. Turning to the challenges faced by his business, Mr Chisaku said one of the raw materials they use in the manufacturing process, sand, is now found very far from their production sites. “The sand is too far from our production sites. The roads to Ngamo where we find the sand are bad and that results in trucks breaking down time and again,” he said. Mr Chisaku said the business has been generous to him and his employees. “I have managed to support my family through my brick-making business. I have three children; Estina, Tarisai and Makanaka. The first two are in Europe for further studies and the little one is at Midlands Christian College in Gweru,” he said. As a company, Mr Chisaku said they now own a number of properties from proceeds generated from the brick-making business. “We have Chantel boarding for pupils up to “A” Level. We also have Makanaka boarding house for Midlands State University (MSU) students and more are on their way. I am just happy that we are growing as the economy grows too,” he said.
