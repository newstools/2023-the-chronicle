The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE country’s traditional football giants, Highlanders and Dynamos will have to find other opponents to continue with their pre-season preparations following cancellation of their planned cancer awareness game. Bosso and DeMbare had agreed to play the cancer awareness match as a part of their social corporate responsibility. The encounter had initially been scheduled for February 19 before organisers moved it to February 26 and now the game has been called off. Michelle Madzudzo, founder of Talk Cancer Zimbabwe who were planning the game said: “There has been some changes. The match has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control.” Highlanders, who had to cut their week-long pre-season camp to four days in Beitbridge as they rushed back to Bulawayo to prepare for the cancer awareness clash are now looking for weekend opponents to give their players game time and work on combinations. Bosso have faced two clubs – Premiership new boys Sheasham and first division side Dulivhadzimu in preseason training games. Highlanders drew 0-0 with Sheasham at Ascot Stadium and went on to play two matches against Dulivhadzimu. They drew the first match against Dulivhadzimu 3-3 and won the final game 3-2. Calvin Chigonero, who is on loan from Talen Vision got his brace in the first game which Highlanders had to overturn the hosts’ 2-0 lead to force a 3-3 draw. Stanley Ngala scored the other goal to save Bosso.  The first match had Highlanders starting with goalkeeper Raphael Pitisi and other players were Rahman Kutsanzira, Andrew Tandi, Godfrey Makaruse, Prince Nyathi, Gillian Nyathi, Washington Navaya, McKinnon Mushore, Divine Mhindirira, Mason Mushore and Stanley Ngala. Chigonero came in as a second half substitute as Bosso turned on the heat. <img class="wp-image-653713 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Andrew-Tandi1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Andrew-Tandi1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Andrew-Tandi1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Andrew Tandi McKinnon, Prince and Gillian were with Highlanders’ development side Bosso-90 last season. In the second encounter that Highlanders won 3-2, Lynoth Chikuhwa who banged 10 Premiership goals last season as well as Ray Lunga were on target. Bosso had goalkeeper Reward Muza who is back from loan at Bulawayo City starting. The other players who completed the starting line-up were Andrew Mbeba, Archford Faira, Mbongeni Ndlovu, Peter Muduhwa, Darlington Mukuli, Melikhaya Ncube, Prince Ndlovu, Lunga, Chikuhwa and Mthabisi Ncube. Dynamos have faced Sheasham, Cranborne Bullets and Black Rhinos during their preseason preparations. Frank Makarati scored the solitary goal in Gweru against Sheasham. DeMbare went on to play two games against Cranborne at Vengere Stadium in Rusape, winning box matches by an identical 2-0 score line. New signings Eli Ilunga and Jayden Bakare were on target in the first game, with Emmanuel Paga and Elvis Moyo scoring in the second match. DeMbare lost the game to Black Rhinos 1-0 before winning the second encounter 2-1 with Moyo and Paga on target. Another proposed encounter between Highlanders and Dynamos was shelved last year. The match was meant to be played on Unity Day. – @ZililoR.
