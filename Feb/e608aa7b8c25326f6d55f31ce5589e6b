The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter MUSIC is therapeutic. It numbs the pain, soothes heartaches, gets one fired up, motivates, and touches heartstrings. Someone familiar with that is Imali eningi hit-maker, L A Beatz (real name Lazarus Nyashanu). Yes, L A Beatz is the unsung hero in arguably the biggest project that South African hip-hop artiste Big Zulu has ever done. In a time when economies where feeling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, he, together with South African trio Big Zulu, Intaba YaseDubai and the late Riky Rick made everyone’s wish to be rich into a song. <img class="size-large wp-image-678383" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/LA-Beatz-with-singer-MarleyGirl-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/LA-Beatz-with-singer-MarleyGirl-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/LA-Beatz-with-singer-MarleyGirl-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> LA Beatz with singer MarleyGirl This week, Saturday Leisure will delve much into what makes the Bulawayo-born Inkabi Records producer tick.
L A Beatz was not born to stardom, he is an Old Lobengula boy and was born 25 years ago. “Growing up in Old Lobengula was in no way easy and just like any other child in the neighborhood, I loved playing in the street but had a distinct love for music, being obsessed with the percussion. From collecting tins, I would play percussionist and from then on, my love for music would grow. “From playing drums at the Apostolic Faith Mission of Africa in Zimbabwe, I then left Zimbabwe in 2014 and joined River of Life Ministries in Johannesburg, continued playing drums and a year later would see me join the professional music sector,” said L.A Beatz. <img class="size-large wp-image-678382" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/L-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/L.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/L-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> L.
