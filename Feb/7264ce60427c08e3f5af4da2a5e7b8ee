The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter NIGERIAN music superstar Burna Boy has been left with regret and pain, following the death of his South African rap rival AKA who was shot dead last Friday. <img class="size-large wp-image-682080" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/FpF858IaMAMWVfl-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/FpF858IaMAMWVfl.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/FpF858IaMAMWVfl-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late AKA (picture credit News24) The Last Last hitmaker expressed his feelings by dedicating a song to the slain rapper on Instagram on Thursday. “WTF is all of that about/ I just heard he died, seen that video at that restaurant/ Took me out of a positive mood. Took me back to that day when you saw my gun and you said I was wild/ Then I told you you should have one too. <img class="size-large wp-image-491859" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Burna-Boy-cover-680x414.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Burna-Boy-cover.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Burna-Boy-cover-360x219.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Burna Boy “Cuz it weren’t like n*ggaz wasn’t dying but I thought you knew/ And I ain’t really f*ck wit you/ But I didn’t want you dead, it was like that with me and you/ Wicked!/ I hope they catch whoever did you wicked/ I hope you rest in peace, even though we ain’t kick it/ At the end of the day we some grown a** nigg*z,” he sang. Burna boy also shared a picture of himself alongside AKA in happier times. Burna Boy and AKA collaborated on three songs, “All Eyes on Me”, “Paid” and “Baddest” but their relationship went sour in 2019 when the pair exchanged bitter words on social media with the former calling AKA “retarded.” Burna Boy was one of the few individuals that the late AKA had beef with. Da L.E.S., Black Coffee, Anatii, and Cassper Nyovest are some of the artistes that AKA crossed paths with AKA. – @MbuleloMpofu
