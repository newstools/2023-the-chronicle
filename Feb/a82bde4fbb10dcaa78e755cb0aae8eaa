Police had initially arrested two learners following Wayne’s fatal stabbing but one of them, a 17-year-old, has appeared in court to answer to murder charges. He was not asked to plead when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Nomagugu Maphosa who remanded him in custody until February 27. Wayne’s father, Mr Simiko Ndlovu said he wanted the funeral service for his son to be held at Founders High School so that learners can have a full appreciation of the consequences of violence. “We are at Founders High School at the moment in a bid to request that his funeral service is held at the school before his burial at Umvutsha Cemetery. It was my wish to have the funeral service held at the school and I’m in the process of engaging the school. I wanted the funeral service to be held at the school so that pupils can have closure and also understand the consequence of violence. Those were my two objectives of wanting the service held at the school,” said Mr Ndlovu. He was still to be granted permission to hold the service at school. Mr Ndlovu said the post-mortem report stated that his son died from bleeding after the stab wound damaged his right jugular vein. -@nqotshili
