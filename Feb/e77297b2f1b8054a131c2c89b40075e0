Zimbabwe has witnessed an increase in drug and substance abuse, especially among youths, forcing all stakeholders to come together and seek solutions to the growing problem. Most of the drugs are allegedly being smuggled from neighbouring countries through Zimbabwe’s porous borders. President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday said the country will beef up security at its ports of entry to ensure that drugs are not smuggled into the country and thus affect the livelihoods of youths. <img class="wp-image-683425 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-16-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-16-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-16-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa The President who was the guest of honour at National Youth Day commemorations that were held in Lupane, Matabeleland North Province said the country is not a drug and illegal substance producer or peddler and will fight to protect youths, who are the future of the country. While no drugs were found among the luggage that was searched Comm Muza said the blitz was ongoing.  In an interview, Comm Muza said the blitz follows a call from members of the public and society at large on the effects of drugs on community. “As you are aware, as ZRP we have launched an operation against drug peddling, drug abuse, and all sorts of crimes where drugs are involved. As Midlands province, we have decided to also make an operation against drug peddling and abuse as a follow-up to the national launch that was carried out in Harare and we are going to be all out in full force searching for these drugs that are harmful to our society,” he said. “Our children are affected, and the young generation which is the future of our nation is at risk of perishing because of drugs. As such and as Midlands province, we want to stamp this out.” Comm Muza said President Mnangagwa has declared zero tolerance to drug peddling and abuse. “So this is what we are doing as the Midlands province. As we speak we have not had any cases, but arrests have been made and perpetrators will be taken to court,” said Comm Muza. He also took time to appeal to travellers against drug peddling and drug abuse. “As I was addressing passengers from the buses, the message we are giving them is very clear, we are saying that drugs are a menace to our children, to our youths, and the society at large. To those involved in the storage and distribution of drugs, we are saying we are out in full force, the net will catch you,” he said. Comm Muza said the blitz will be extended to commercial and residential areas and other places such as night spots which are potential drug hubs.
