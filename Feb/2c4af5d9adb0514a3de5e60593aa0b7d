The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter SECURITY of journalists and ethical reporting emerged among the top concerns affecting relations between media and the police with the two sectors pledging to work closely to address any issues arising ahead of the 2023 harmonised elections. Last week, journalists held a meeting with senior police officers led by Bulawayo Provincial Commander Commissioner Patson Nyabadza in Bulawayo in a bid to strengthen relations. <img class="wp-image-678123 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/lokjhy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/lokjhy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/lokjhy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Commissioner Patson Nyabadza The meeting was held at the Zimbabwe Republic Police Provincial headquarters at Ross Camp and was attended by police district commanders and a team from police Headquarters in Harare. Journalists led by officials from Media Alliance of Zimbabwe, Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa Zimbabwe) and Zimbabwe National Editors Forum (Zinef) said while ZRP recognises the role of the media in society, it is sometimes hampered by some junior police officers. Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (Zuj) secretary general Perfect Hlongwane said journalists’ safety is threatened mostly at political rallies and police play an important role in protecting them as they work. He said media unions are also in the process of engaging political parties considering the role their members play in threatening the work of journalists.  “Journalists are not enemies, journalists are not criminals so allow them to do their jobs as it is allowed by the Constitution,” he said. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said it is crucial to have a good working relationship between police and the media. He said President Mnangagwa’s Government has created an enabling environment for symbiotic relations between the police and the media with police entertaining all media. “The Second Republic has created a conducive environment for the media and police to work together. It is a fact that relations between the police and the media were not good. We used to attack each other such that journalists were now viewing the police as an enemy and the police officers viewed the media as an enemy. I’m happy that in Bulawayo province to be quite honest we are enjoying good relations with the media. We have not had contentious issues,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said as the country inches towards general elections, the media should guard against being used by political players who deliberately issue false statements. “As we move towards the 2023 elections, there are people who will come to the media and some will raise genuine issues but some will exaggerate. If you know some of these guys (district commanders), they will be able to notify you and set the record straight. I know there was one case here in Bulawayo where someone applied to have a gathering and the regulatory authority cleared that gathering but unfortunately that gathering was being held at a company premise and the owners of the premises said yes you have been cleared by the regulatory authority but the building belongs to us. The convener of the meeting then went to the media and misrepresented facts,” he said. “We also want to caution, I’m happy that in Bulawayo province we do not have cases. In some provinces, there are some politicians who want to move around with journalists and in the process they provoke and sometimes they are committing crimes in the presence of the media so that they are arrested in the full glare of the media.” Asst Comm Nyathi urged media players to always seek confirmation before writing damaging stories. — @nqotshili
