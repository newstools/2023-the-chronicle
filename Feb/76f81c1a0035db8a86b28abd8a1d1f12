The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter HOCKEY Association of Zimbabwe (HAZ) have called up Bulawayo-based Amber Tozana to the Under-21 women’s team that is set to take part in the 2023 Africa Junior Championship. Tozana was in the reserves after the final 18 member squad was announced late last year after she was originally part of the provisional list. The championship is scheduled to take place next month in Egypt. Head coach Brad Heuer confirmed that the Girls College learner has been called to the side to replace an injured player. “Amy Hay picked up a knee injury so we had to replace her with Amber Tozana and it was made official,” said Heuer. <img class="wp-image-680627 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-8-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-8-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-8-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Amber Tozana HAZ hosted exhibition matches a couple of weeks back as they prepare for the continental showdown which is edging closer with each day. Both their teams (men and women) played against select sides whom they beat 2-0 as a sign of their preparedness for the upcoming tournament.  After the matches, Heuer indicated that preparations have been going well for the team as they have been playing well. Since the start of January, he said the players have been jelling well and learning more about each other, how they play and even what they like. However, Zimbabwe’s preparation has been disturbed by lack of sponsorship and they are appealing to individuals and corporates to help assist them in making sure their dream becomes a reality. Last week HAZ announced a sponsorship deal with two different organisations who have come in to support them in their journey. They got sponsorship from Ethiopian Airlines and Savvy Traveller who have taken them a step closer to Egypt. Taking part in the tournament will give the youngsters the much needed international experience and exposure. The Junior Africa Championship will serve as a direct qualifier for the 2023 Junior World Cup with the winner and runner-up qualifying. The new addition to the women’s team, Tozana will join the team in Harare as they are intensifying their preparations with the tournament date closer. – @brandon_malvin
