The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN swimmer, Denilson Cyprianos continued to show his skill in the pool after he wrapped up a successful weekend in the United States of America during the League Summit in Minnesota. Cyprianos competed in three events, which were 100-metre backstroke where he finished with the sixth fastest time, 1650 freestyle and finished with a solid second place in the men’s 200 yards backstroke, with just 0, 18 split seconds off the gold medal and setting a school record. His time also qualified him for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) B as he continues with his impressive form in the USA. His relay team also set a school record in the 200-metre free relay.
Apart from making the NCAA B cut, he also qualified for the National Invitation Tournaments (NITs) which will be held in two weeks’ time.  Cyprianos moved to the United States of America at the beginning of January 2021 on a swimming scholarship at Carson-Newman University and he was quick to show his potential during Senior Day where he won five races. The former Christian College Brothers (CBC) head boy won the men’s 1000 freestyle (9:42.89), swimming the event for the first time, the men’s 200-freestyle in 1:45.10, the men’s 100 back in 50.45, the men’s 200 backstroke in a time of 1:49.70 and also clinched victory in the men’s 500 freestyle with a time of 4:46.82.
Winning the races on his debut, became the first swimmer for Carson-Newman Swimming to win five events in one competition. — @brandon_malvin
