The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE will be looking to cause an upset when they play against Uruguay in the two-day Davis Cup World Group II play-off tie starting at Harare Sports Club today. Ranked number 67 in the world, Zimbabwe will be eager to upstage the number 42 ranked Uruguay who will be banking on their seasoned campaigners like Ariel Behar and Martin Cuevas. Behar has a world doubles ranking of 48. The other members of the Uruguayan team are Ignacio Carou, Franco Roncadelli and Joaquin Aguilar Cardozo. They will be led by Enrique Perez-Cassarino. The home side who have Takanyi Garanganga as the non-playing captain, have their hopes pinned on the experience of the Lock brothers, Benjamin and Courtney, who have been part of the team for some time and have proved to be key members. The brothers come with vast capabilities having participated in different Challenger Tours globally. <img class="wp-image-468481 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Takanyi-Garanganga-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Takanyi-Garanganga-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Takanyi-Garanganga--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Takanyi Garanganga Other members of the Zimbabwean team are Mehluli Sibanda and Benedict Badza.

We are really looking forward to it and we are just trying to adjust back to the altitude and get ready for the tie. Courney said people are going to see some world class tennis.  “I think their doubles player (Ariel Behar) has just come from the Australian Open. So it’s tennis at the highest level and I think everyone is looking forward to it. I think it will be very good tennis,” he said. Zimbabwe earned promotion back into World Group II in August last year when they beat Namibia 2-1 in a promotional play-off at the Africa Group III event in Algiers, <img class="wp-image-678066 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gt78.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gt78.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/gt78-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benjamin Lock Algeria and will be hoping to also secure promotion to the next stage which is Group I of the decorated tennis competition. — @brandon_malvin
