The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter LOGAN Cup defending champions Tuskers will be hoping to redeem themselves when they go up against old rivals Eagles in a match starting today at Harare Sports Club. In the previous encounter between the two teams, the Bulawayo side suffered a heavy defeat and will be hoping to get things right this time around. Tuskers lost the match by an innings and 33 runs.
Tuskers will be hoping to get back the form they had at the beginning of the season where they won their first two matches to have the perfect start to the competition after they lost the services of seasoned campaigner Craig Ervine to Eagles. <img class="wp-image-674175 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/oqwas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/oqwas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/oqwas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Craig Ervine Their last two Logan Cup matches however ended as draws after rain interrupted the proceedings where they were having the upper hand of taking home the maximum points.
Head coach Walter Chawaguta said they are ready for tomorrow’s clash as they have had time to have training sessions without rain interruption and the team’s physiotherapist is hard at work making sure that everyone in the squad is fully fit for the match. “The preparations have been going very well, the weather has been kind to us in the last couple of days and we are ready for the match. The team physio is working hard making sure that everyone is fit,” said Chawaguta.  The Bulawayo side however had rain disturb some of their matches which they seemed to be in control of which Chawaguta said hurt them and took away the opportunity to get back to winning ways. Going into the clash against Eagles, Chawaguta said despite losing captain Brian Chari and Ervine, the team has good reinforcements as some players have returned to beef up the squad and believes they have a better team than the one that played the first match against the rivals. Tuskers will also be banking on the form of wicketkeeper/batter Clive Madande who scored a hundred in the previous match against Mountaineers and the experience of Nkosana Mpofu, Ernest Masuku and Ainsley Ndlovu to lead the team to victory. <img class="wp-image-674182 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/plqwafujb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/plqwafujb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/plqwafujb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Clive Madande Chawaguta is confident his team will do well and pick up maximum points in the match. He added that it will take some time to replace Ervine and Chari who were the team’s leading run scorers last season but has faith in the young players he has to get the job done.
The other match that will take place will be between Rhinos and Southern Rocks at Old Hararians. — @brandon_malvin
