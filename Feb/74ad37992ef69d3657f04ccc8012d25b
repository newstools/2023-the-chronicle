The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Senior Reporter DESPITE being born with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a bone disorder, Mr Nqobile Khumalo (28) from Cowdray Park suburb had always been hopeful for a brighter future. While people living with disabilities are often regarded as beggars with no space in academic corridors, Mr Khumalo went through his primary right up to tertiary education, defying the odds. OI is an inherited (genetic) bone disorder that is present at birth. It is also known as brittle bone disease and a child born with OI may have soft bones that break (fracture) easily, bones that are not formed normally, and other problems. Sharing his story of hope with Chronicle yesterday, Mr Khumalo said the mantra of his former headmistress at King George VI Memorial School in Khumalo suburb whom he identified only as Mrs P Hadebe is what kept him going until he graduated with his first degree. “If you are given a chance dubula,” she would say and that was enough to keep Mr Khumalo motivated through his academic years although he was often the only child with a disability in his class. “I did my Grade One at Siyazama primary school located at Lochard Resettlement Area, Insiza. In 2006 I transferred to King George VI Memorial School (KG VI) where I heard the headmistress saying, ‘If you are given a chance dubula’. My headmistress preached it whenever addressing us during assembly and that has been my source of strength and courage,” he said. “From that time I realised that I was given a chance at education by my one and only aunt Norah Khumalo and with that in mind, I managed to come out with flying colours in my Grade 7 and Ordinary Level. In 2016 I went to Luveve High School for Advanced Level since at KG VI I could only complete Form Four.” He said his new school was somewhat different from KG VI where learners with disabilities were mixed with the able-bodied.  “I had to shake off the culture shock that was lingering on my back because I was the only one who had a disability. After a month I felt welcomed because the school didn’t tolerate any form of discrimination which made me comfortable as the only disabled learner. I worked twice as hard at school since I had this conviction that despite my disability I could excel at my studies.” In January 2018 his A-Level results came out and on his way to collect them, his aunt promised him that he would proceed to university if he passed which was music to his ears. “I gave a fake laugh trying not to show her that I was uncertain about my result. Later I went to collect my results and I was surprised by how I had nailed it despite challenges, I got 8 points.” Mr Khumalo went on to do his degree and last year he graduated with a Bachelor of Honours Degree in Language and Communication from Lupane State University. <img class="wp-image-636877 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Lupane-State-University.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Lupane-State-University.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Lupane-State-University-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lupane State University “I promised my family that I’m going to bring that degree home. When it was time to go and start my university life my family reminded me to never forget that I had promised them to bring a degree. It was tough but when I look back I just cannot believe I came this far because it’s only a handful of PWDs who manage to ignore the stigma and fight this hard. I remember when I got an internship at the National Railways of Zimbabwe public relations department, I couldn’t believe that someone like me deserved it but am grateful for the support that my family gave me.” Mr Khumalo is job-seeking but lives off temporary teaching as he is also passionate about languages. “I still feel the need to further my education because I feel like I have not reached my full potential in terms of education. I want to show the world that even a disabled individual can succeed and become an asset not a liability to the community hence the reason for my wish. I also wish to show the world that hard work, resilience, and self-discipline pays. This will enable me to give back to the community the knowledge that I would have acquired in my education journey. To anyone facing giants in form of challenges, I say go forward and chase those dreams because anything is possible even for disabled people if we believe.” He added that one day he will marry and have a family although he is currently not in a relationship. –@thamamoe
