The Chronicle I discovered something quite nifty this past week, well actually it wasn’t a discovery but more of a surprise . . . Remember back when you were a kid and never fancied those black liquorice sweet sticks? They tasted horrible, right? That’s because they are a confection usually flavoured and coloured black with the extract of the roots of the liquorice plant Glycyrrhiza glabra. Anyway, this week I felt kind of lazy to waltz around bars searching for new cocktail recipes and besides, I felt my body needed rest and detox. So here I am sitting in a friend’s car, chatting and catching up while sipping on juice. I realised the fellow was getting quite cheery all of a sudden, his mood has turned somewhat euphoric…  He had a tiny bag of gummies he had been munching on, which I declined when he offered, I can’t stand the prickly and numb feeling of my gums after chewing on those sweets. I asked him if he had taken something before and he let out a mischievous laugh saying he had been ingesting something alcoholic from the time we met. I peered down at the gummies and looked at him before he put on a smile. Shaking my head as I tried a couple. I enjoyed them, sweet but somewhat sour, with lovely liquor tones and scent both on the tongue and nose if I may add. So, after a few of them I felt a slight zing, you know the one you get just as you are getting tipsy? So, we parted ways but before that, he did tell me his “plug”. Mind you, these are not drugs, just alcohol-infused gummies. <img class="alignnone wp-image-432342 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/‘excessive’-alcohol-intake.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/‘excessive’-alcohol-intake.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/‘excessive’-alcohol-intake-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> I got myself a packet and well, the feeling wasn’t really what I expected. I thought I would get high off a packet of sweets but all they did was leave me hanging. Then the “brightest of ideas” popped up. I got another packet and decided to experiment. I met up with my friend again and we bought nips of Jameson, Sky Vodka and Belgravia. I am pretty sure you know where this is going. We bought ourselves gummies or jelly babies, call them what you may. Picked out some colours that we mixed with the different liquors and let them soak in different cups before mixing them up again to bring a colourful and fruity flavoured drink. The trick here is the gelatin in the gummies absorbs the alcohol, giving them a burst of boozy flavour after they double in size. <img class="alignnone wp-image-336838 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/drunk.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/drunk.jpg 678w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/drunk-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /> Well, that’s this week’s cocktail.
