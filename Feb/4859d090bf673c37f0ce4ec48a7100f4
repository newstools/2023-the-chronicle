The Chronicle Nqobile Bhebhe, Senior Business Reporter BEITBRIDGE Municipality has proposed an ambitious program to develop a solar farm to generate renewable electricity on 67 to 100 hectares of land as part of measures to help meet its power requirements and cut greenhouse gas emissions. According to the local authority, it will lease land located within its Beitbridge farm for an agreed number of years. “Municipality of Beitbridge has released an Express of Interest as part of a plan to develop a new solar farm project. “The proposed solar farm project is planned to be located within the Municipality of Beitbridge farm and generate renewable electricity to help meet the power needs,” reads part of the Expression of Interest notice. “Municipality of Beitbridge is committed to reducing its net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. The proposed solar farm is one initiative designed to help meet this ambitious goal.” The local authority said the onsite solar farm project to help generate power is one practical way to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change. “The proposed site is between 67-100 hectares of land, to build and operate this plant. The Municipality of Beitbridge will lease land for an agreed number of years. Interested firms are called upon to obtain a Standard Request for Expression of Interest.” The planned solar power project dovetails with the Government’s thrust to promote green energy development. Through the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera), the Government has licensed dozens of independent power producers to generate clean energy such as gas, solar, and hydro-electricity. This is also in keeping with the global trends on the need to curb pollution and global warming through investment in environmentally friendly power projects.
