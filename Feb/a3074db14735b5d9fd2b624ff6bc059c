They expressed gratitude for the support they have received. “To us, Tebello was a son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend. To many he was Tibz Wa Bantwana, Chief of Cool, Summer Time Cool Creator, K1 K9, and the many other names of affection. Our son was loved and he gave love in return. As we come to terms with the devastating truth that our only son is no longer with us we appeal for your compassion, space and time to congregate as a family to decide on the upcoming days. “We thank you for the love and support we have received and ask you to continue to lift us up in prayer before the Lord.” @Constance Gaanakgomo/Sowetan Live
