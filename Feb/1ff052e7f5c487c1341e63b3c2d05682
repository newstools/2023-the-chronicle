The Chronicle Mkhululi Ncube, Showbiz Reporter AFTER going separate ways with his long-time music partner Kholwani TK Dube, Alfred Sibanda who has been part of Dubia Masters Band for years says he is still weighing his options on the next steps. News of the pair’s separation last year, soon after the release of their ninth album Somthola Khona, shocked many Rhumba fans as they had fallen in love with their combination. The diminutive dancer, guitarist and backing vocalist, who has had a dance with many Rhumba bands which include Ndolwane Super Sounds, Allen Ndoda and Baba KaNjivana said he is lying low at the moment. <img class="wp-image-564693 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Allan-Ndoda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Allan-Ndoda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Allan-Ndoda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Allen Ndoda “My separation with TK was very amicable and ngabavalelisa ngezizatho ezithize which are personal on my side. For now, I’m planning my next move but what I can tell you is I have not left music and definitely something is brewing. For now, what I can say is that everything will be clear after about five months,” he said. Sibanda said he is still on talking terms with TK ruling out any bad blood between the pair. The South African based musician, who hails from Gokwe, but was born and grew up in Lupane did not dismiss the thought of working with TK in the future. “There is still a chance for us to work together on projects but after some years,” said Sibanda. The father of three said he has been in the Rhumba music industry for a long time since his school days.  “I started music while still at school with Sobendle Super Sound from Lupane but unfortunately, we did not record following the death of the band leader. After that I worked with Ubaba KaNjivana and Masiya Brothers in 2004 and I moved with them to South Africa. I was his backing vocalist and dancer. “We recorded three albums before I met TK in 2008 through bassist Dennis Nkomazana who I grew up with. We joined Ndolwane Super Sounds although TK had his own project. Our first project with TK was in 2010 when we recorded the album Uyisithuth` Esinjani,” said Sibanda. Dubia Masters won the best Rhumba category under the Roil-Bulawayo Arts Awards which were held in December. -@themkhust
