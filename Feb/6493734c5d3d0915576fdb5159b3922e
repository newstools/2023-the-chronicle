The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief GOVERNMENT has availed $60 million for the procurement of industrial machinery at Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo (JMN) Polytechnic’s Home Economics Complex which will be turned into an innovation hub. The construction of the Home Economics complex, which is now in its final stages of completion, has brought excitement among students as it is going to be a game changer in the industrialisation of the country. The innovation hub is also expected to benefit graduates who intend to start their own businesses in line with the Education 5.0 model, which is a five-mission model of teaching, research, community service, innovation and industrialisation. It speaks to the utilisation of local resources for social and economic development. The new model, which was adopted five years ago, seeks to produce graduates who solve national problems instead of just being job seekers. The Home Economics complex will also address the shortage of learning space at JMN Nkomo Polytechnic.
Once complete, it will house a clothing factory and accommodate students pursuing practical courses such as tourism and hospitality, professional cookery, textile and clothing design.  It is envisaged to become a major Food Science and Technology Centre and an incubation ground for new companies.
The country adopted Education 5.0 whose goal is to industrialise and modernise the country. JMN Polytechnic principal Dr Ngoni Moyo said students will form consortiums where they will come together as groups and use the practical skills that they would have acquired from the institution to start income-generating projects. She said the Government has allocated $60 million towards buying state-of-the-art equipment for the innovation hub.
“As a college, we now see the Home Economics complex as an innovation and industrial hub. This is an important structure which will help us as an institution to implement the Education 5.0 model,” she said. <img class="size-full wp-image-342086" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/Prof-Jona-moyo-on-grants1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/Prof-Jona-moyo-on-grants1.jpg 640w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/Prof-Jona-moyo-on-grants1-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> Prof Jonathan Moyo (right) and JMN Poly principal Dr Ngoni Moyo (left) Dr Ngoni said upon its completion, there will be a lot of industrial activities at the college.
