The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) is inviting tenders for the provision of an electronic ticketing system for the 2023 season which is expected to get under way this month. Since 2014, the PSL has been trying to have the system in place and there was even a trial run in 2019 where tickets for some games were sold online. At that time, the PSL had a plan to gradually introduce the ticketing system. The next two years saw no football owing to Covid-19. According to the PSL, tenders will be accepted upon payment of US$50. “Tender documents with the scope of services are obtainable from the Premier Soccer League offices for a non-refundable fee of US$50. All tenders submitted will only be accepted upon payment of the fee. The closing date is March 1,” PSL said.  The new system is expected to ensure football fans access tickets way before the match from selected outlets such as leading supermarkets and other relevant outlets. The new system is expected to improve the number of fans who go to stadiums to watch football as it would be easier to access entry tickets. There is a lot of pushing and shoving when people jostle for tickets at entry points with others ending up losing valuables to thieves. The system will reduce congestion, save time and will improve transparency as it will give out the actual number of fans that would have paid to watch the match. The league kick-off with the Castle Challenge Cup between the Chibuku Super Cup winners Bulawayo Chiefs and Castle Lager Premiership champions FC Platinum. The venue and date for the tie are yet to be announced. Both sides are gearing up for the tie. Amakhosi Amahle, who have been facing financial challenges which have seen them lose five key players, have appointed Lizwe Sweswe as their new coach. <img class="wp-image-674910 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-8-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-8-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-8-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lizwe Sweswe This sets up an interesting cup tie as Sweswe has previously worked under Norman Mapeza at FC Platinum. -@innocentskizoe
