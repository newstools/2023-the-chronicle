The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Business Reporter CONSTRUCTION of the Nkulumane Fruit and Vegetable Market for small-scale traders in Bulawayo is expected to be complete by the end of next month to pave the way for official commissioning in April. The facility was initially set for completion in September last year but was delayed due to modifications that necessitated extra work. The fruit and vegetable market is being constructed near Nkulumane Mall where producers will be able to rent stalls and sell their products to potential buyers. The project is being driven by the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works under the Building Urban Resilience in Zimbabwe through ‘Safe Markets and Green Solutions’ programme.
Bulawayo City Council (BCC) corporate communications officer, Mrs. Nesisa Mpofu, said construction is ongoing and was expected to be completed by end of March 2023, followed by official commissioning.  She said the wholesale market infrastructure project is expected to have a number of positive impacts and benefits for the community of Bulawayo. “It should decongest the city by receiving all traders from Bulawayo and outside as it is strategically positioned, foster a resilient Bulawayo from pandemics and other external shocks,” said Mrs Mpofu. “The central business district (CBD) will be cleaner as manageable numbers will be received on a daily basis and bring life to the Nkulumane complex through the fruits and vegetables products and other complementary activities.”
She also said the market is expected to improve the livelihoods of the community as a number of people will be employed in various market activities. Mrs Mpofu said the project will also go a long way in reducing the risks of women, youth, and vulnerable groups who had to wake up around 4am to queue in town in order to access fruits and vegetables.
The market will ease decongestion in the city centre, which is usually flooded by fruit and vegetable producers on a daily basis, she said. <img class="wp-image-613147 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-1-copy-177-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo City Council (BCC) After project completion, there will not be any need for informal traders and members of the public to travel to the city centre to buy vegetables when they can be accessed in their localities, said Mrs Mpofu.
She added that the city of Bulawayo was working on designing an effective and adaptable allocation model that will eliminate space barons. “The City of Bulawayo has also learnt lessons from sister local authorities in order to develop a best practice model. The model will be balanced and contemporary, benefitting all the stakeholders,” said Mrs. Mpofu.
The construction of the market is part of the decentralisation programme for the City of Bulawayo and buttresses the local development plan whereby the council is setting up commercial centres at different places after Covid-19.
Following the lockdown proclamation, the council had to come up with a resilient food supply system program during and after the pandemic.
