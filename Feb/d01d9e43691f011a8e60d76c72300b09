The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD striker Dalubuhle Dlodlo has joined Bulawayo Chiefs following a successful trial stint with the ambitious side. Dlodlo, who played a leading role at relegated Premiership side Bulawayo City, made the grade ahead of veteran Kudakwashe Musharu among other footballers who have been training with Bulawayo Chiefs hoping to impress coach Lizwe Sweswe. The former national Under-20 striker who banged in four goals for Bulawayo City last season and provided 13 assists, will compete for a starting place with Obriel Chirinda and Farau Matare who led the strike force last season. <img class="size-large wp-image-669796" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-45-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-45-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-45-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Obriel Chirinda Dlodlo, a new addition to the squad, joins two other forwards who were playing in the Zifa Southern Region Division One Soccer League, 29-year-old Ayanda Ncube (Talen Vision) and ex-Quality Foods’ Stanson Khanye (27). Ncube, formerly with defunct Premiership side Tsholotsho FC had 18 assists for Talen Vision and scored seven goals last year while Khanye had 19 goals for Quality Foods to finish as the Southern Region top goal scorer.  Sweswe, content with his team’s rebuilding exercise, will be hoping that combinations will come out well following the arrival of new players. “We’re still working on our rebuilding exercise and very soon we’re having training games with lower division teams to see how combinations are coming up. We also hope these guys we’ve added will adapt quickly and grasp our philosophy,” said Sweswe. Former national team midfielder Danny “Deco” Phiri and seasoned utility player William Stima are the other players signed by Amakhosi Amahle. Bulawayo Chiefs lost the trio of Moyo twins Elvis and Kevin as well as Arthur “Diego” Musiyiwa to Dynamos, utility player Kelvin Madzongwe who found home at Caps United as well as forward Perfect Chikwende who rejoined FC Platinum. Attacking midfielder Hughe Chikosa has headed to Simba Bhora, with goalkeepers David Bizabani and Matripples Muleya moving to Green Fuel and Triangle United respectively. Bulawayo Chiefs are also closing in on ex-national team midfielder Last Jesi. The former Manica Diamonds FC and FC Platinum midfield genius, who had a brief spell at Al Hilal FC of Sudan in 2020, seems to have impressed Sweswe. <img class="wp-image-673179 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dsds23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dsds23.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/dsds23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Arthur ‘Diego’ Musiyiwa Jesi, who featured for Al Hilal in five Champions League matches and was named Man-of-the-Match twice will be hoping to make an immediate impact at Bulawayo Chiefs just like he did in Sudan. At Al Hilal, Jesi made an instant impact on arrival when he scored on his debut as the Omdurman-based side drew 1-1 against Hay-Al-Arab in a Premier League. Upon termination of his contract with the Sudan side, Jesi returned to join Ngezi Platinum Stars. Former Black Rhinos’ goalkeeper Herbert Rusawo has also been training with Bulawayo Chiefs who are looking at replacing Bizabani and Muleya. Former Young Warriors goalkeeper Issah Ali (23) formerly with Ngezi Platinum Stars, ex-Bulawayo City’s Aaron “Arusha” Ngwenya (25), former TelOne FC’s William Muvuya (20) as well as Justin Ncube who was at Bosso-90 have also been training with Bulawayo Chiefs. The club is set to sign three goalkeepers for the 2023 season. — @ZililoR
