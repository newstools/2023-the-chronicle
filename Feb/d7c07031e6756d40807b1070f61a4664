The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter BUS operators have challenged authorities to deal with pirate taxis on the country’s roads saying they are contributing to lawlessness. This comes as the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) is struggling to deal with crews that are picking and dropping passengers at undesgnated places in the city. The illegal activities by bus crews have attracted touts and vendors.
In an interview yesterday, Bulawayo Bus Operators Association chairman Mr Patrick Dube said while buses under his association were not operating from undesignated places, bus ranks have become a white elephants as passengers are no longer there to board buses. He said passengers prefer hiking when buses are waiting for them at designated pickup points.
This has forced some bus operators to follow passengers to the undesignated ranks.  Mr Dube said he was not pushing for the suspension of licences for bus crews that were picking up passengers at illegal pick up points as previously reported. He said a holistic approach to solving the problem in the transport sector is required. “Our buses service rural routes and they pick up passengers at Renkini Bus Terminus, Entumbane Rank and Nkulumane Complex rank. Some passengers after shopping find it easy to go to an illegal pickup point as opposed to going to Renkini Bus Terminus,” said Mr Dube. He said buses were therefore losing business to pirate taxis which were operating from illegal pick-up points. “Even if you force all the buses to rank at Renkini, the problem will not be solved as long as pirate taxis are allowed to operate,” said Mr Dube. <img class="size-large wp-image-678328" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/rrrrree-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/rrrrree.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/rrrrree-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> File picture: Buses at an illegal rank in Bulawayo He said the transport sector last month held a national two-day workshop with the aim of addressing some of the problems affecting them. Mr Dube said the meeting was organised by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development. “It was a two-day conference where operators were free to contribute in finding solutions. We did tell them plainly about the road infrastructure, the issue of pirate taxis was also raised during that meeting and it was stated that they were doing more harm than good,” said Mr Dube. “It was raised that pirate taxis are a problem throughout the country. So, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development is working on it and we are now waiting for the implementation of those resolutions. There is a lot of work that needs to be done by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development.” Turning to the BCC planned upgrade of Renkini Bus Terminus, he said the project is long overdue as the place is no longer suitable for business. The area has been deserted by bus operators and is mainly dominated by vendors.
