The Chronicle Mukudzei Chingwere, Harare Bureau PRESIDENT Mnangagwa will be with youths at the national youth Indaba on drug and substance abuse in Lupane during the National youth day celebrations, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said yesterday. Speaking after yesterday’s cabinet meeting, she noted that Robert Gabriel Mugabe National Youth Day is celebrated every year on 21 February to recognise youth, and to reflect on their contributions to socio-economic development and encourage them to adopt sound leadership values by emulating the ethos espoused by national liberators since independence. This year’s event is aimed at raising awareness to keep youths away from society’s ills of drug and substance abuse.
As authorities grapple with the need to end drug abuse, Government has quickly moved in to ensure that all youth’s engagements carry the message of discouraging drug abuse. “Cabinet advises that youth in Zimbabwe account for 35 percent of the population and remain the most active asset to the nation and if harnessed correctly stand to contribute immensely to the economic development of the country,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.
“The youth day has been identified as an event that Government should invest in to celebrate youth and together with the young people to take stock of programmes and initiatives to inculcate values that the said fore-bearers display for national development.  “Launching celebrations and decentralising National Youth Day will enable youth and Government to engage in community specific change programmes, providing young people with ownership, accountability, responsibility and sustainability of initiatives.
“It should be highlighted that the proposed awards for excelling youth in various sectors will encourage and improve the recognition of the work of the youth hence attracting more youths to serve their communities positively,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. <img class="size-large wp-image-677118" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/lopiolik-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/lopiolik.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/lopiolik-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa She advised the nation that to launch the National Youth Celebrations, the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation in collaboration with other Government Ministries will host a National Youth Indaba on drug and substance abuse in Lupane.
