The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter AS Zimbabwe’s “Open Skies Policy” continues to attract more airlines into the country, Government has vowed to upscale momentum through enhancing aviation infrastructure modernisation in line with global standards. Developing an efficient air transport system is critical in enhancing economic growth in line with the country’s aspirations as expressed under the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). Government is upgrading airport infrastructure countrywide in an effort to meet international standards and attract more airlines.  This has seen the country attracting international airlines such as Eurowings Discover, Emirates, Ethiopian Airways, South African Airways, Kenyan Airways, South Africa’s Airlink and Fastjet among others. Such positive global market response demands that the Airports Company of Zimbabwe (ACZ) crafts strategies that consolidate the country’s attractiveness to airlines, Acting Permanent Secretary for Transport and Infrastructural Development, Dr Loveness Masuka-Dumwa, said. While Government is satisfied with the strides made so far by the ACZ in attracting airlines into the country, as well as increasing flight frequencies, she said more could still be done. She was speaking at a recent Strategic Planning Workshop for ACZ, which was held in Victoria Falls under the theme “Expanding possibilities”. “This strategic planning gathering speaks volumes on the progress ACZ is making in ensuring the alignment of its targets with developmental targets as set out in NDS 1,” said Dr Masuka-Dumwa. <img class="wp-image-629392 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-213.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-213.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-213-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Airports Company of Zimbabwe (ACZ) “It’s, thus, also apt to affirm that Zimbabwe skies are open for airlines, and so are our airports. This places considerable demands on ACZ to come up with vibrant strategies that will make our airports attractive to new airlines. “I urge the ACZ board and management to ramp up your infrastructure and service delivery model to quench the appetite of the ever-changing demands of international travellers whose taste is quite varied,” she said. “I’m happy to note that such a thrust is already underway and being earnestly pursued through the initiative of Air Access and Service Development Program and activities such as route development.” The upgrading of airport facilities is part of Government’s 100-day cycle project implementation adopted a few years ago for the management of key quick-win projects.
