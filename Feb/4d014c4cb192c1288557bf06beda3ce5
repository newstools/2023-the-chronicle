The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Business Reporter THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has allotted US$18,2 million to businesses at the Foreign Currency Auction System this week amid the weakening value of the local currency against the United States dollar, which is now trading at US$1: ZWL$801 from US$1:ZWL$779. When the auction system closed in mid-December for the festive holiday season, the official exchange rate was pegged at US$1: ZWL$671,4. The Auction System resumed trading three weeks ago with the official rate pegged at US$1: ZWL$705 and has since moved upwards to ZWL$732, ZWL$779, and ZWL$801 respectively. In the latest update after Tuesday’s auction, the RBZ said a total of US$16,4 million was allotted for the main auction and US$1,8 million for the Small to Medium Enterprises sector, making it a total of US$18,2 million. At this week’s results, the main auction accepted bids worth US$23,9 million while the SMEs platform accepted US$2,9 million.
