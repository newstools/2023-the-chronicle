The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Reporter THE 2022 Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (Zimsec) Ordinary Level results were released yesterday with 4 961 candidates out of the 278 760 that sat for the examinations having their results nullified for having pre-access to the examination papers. The pass rate went up by 2,62 percent to 28,96 compared to the 2021 results.
The nullification of results is in conformity with the Zimsec Act. The examinations body said it still reserves the right to withhold results after the publication date and to also withdraw results from a candidate if evidence of malpractice before or during the writing of examinations is provided. <img class="wp-image-544614 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Prof-Mwenje-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Prof-Mwenje.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Prof-Mwenje-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimsec board chairperson Professor Eddie Mwenje In a statement Zimsec board chairperson Professor Eddie Mwenje said the examinations body was committed to upholding the integrity of the Zimbabwe examination system. “In this regard, Zimsec was seized with the 2022 examination malpractices and the problems which occurred were dealt with decisively,” said Prof Mwenje. He said a statement was thus issued on October 17, 2022 informing the nation that some candidates had been found to have had pre-access to some Ordinary Level question papers. The examinations body issued subsequent statements on October 20 and November 10 last year as well as January 17 this year as updates on the investigations into the matter.  “Candidates who had pre-access to question papers of different papers at different examination centres were identified during the writing of the examinations and also at the marking of scripts and grade review stages. The results of such candidates were nullified for the subjects in question in accordance with the Zimsec Act, Section 34,” said Prof Mwenje. He said any examination centres that were complicit to the examination malpractice will be de-registered.
In terms of the result statistics, a total of 183 584 wrote five or more subjects with 53 169 getting five or more subjects at Grade C or better compared to 163 179 who wrote five or more subjects with 42 985 passing five subjects at Grade C or better the previous year.

For 2021, female candidates recorded a 25,4 percent pass rate. There were 132 653 male candidates who wrote five or more subjects and out of the figure, 86 018 passed five or more subjects to register a 25,16 percent pass rate. “Results can be accessed online by candidates or authorised personnel.
