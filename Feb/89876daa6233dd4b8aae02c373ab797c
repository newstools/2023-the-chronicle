The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Premier Soccer League coach Philani Mabhena and ex Highlanders left back Gift Lunga (jnr) have headlined a number of local coaches that have been interviewed for coaching jobs that recently fell vacant at Zifa Southern Region Division One side Talen Vision. According to an impeccable source the overwhelming response also saw former Manica Diamonds coach Johanisi Nhumwa, ex Bantu Rovers and Black Mambas player Fortune “Fokoza” Ncube, Golding Dube and an unnamed foreign coach from Slovakia going through the interview process. Ncube is the brains behind the Fortune Fokoza Foundation that has been hosting junior boys and girls tournaments in Bulawayo’s high density suburb of Entumbane. The source also revealed that the process concluded on Wednesday with ex Ngezi Platinum Stars and Highlanders goalkeepers mentor Cosmas “Tsano” Zulu interviewing those aspiring to be goal minders coaches at the ambitious Filabusi based side where Xolani “Skweya” Nkundhlande reportedly wants a comeback. While he could not be drawn to confirm the names of the coaches they have interviewed, Talen Vision chairman Elton Sinyosi acknowledged that they had embarked on the interviewing procedure.  “I can’t mention names but I can confirm that we have six to seven coaches. We haven’t appointed anyone as we wait for recommendations to be made to us by those who conducted the interviews since last week. Yes, there is a foreign coach who has been interviewed, he has worked with the club before but that does not mean it will automatically make the grade. The appointment will probably be made early next week,” said Sinyosi. Miroslav Nemec is the Slovakian coach who has previously worked with Talen Vision. “As you know that there is a lot that is taking place at Talen Vision. We are a brand that everyone wants to be associated with. We have a college named Ivinar Park Academy and we would like to appoint coaches that will be aligned to the institution. At our club coaches have come and gone because we always want to see people grow. We don’t want to see people remain stagnant,’’ added Sinyosi. The mentoring jobs at Talen Vision are untaken following the departure of Lizwe Sweswe and his assistant Sithethelelwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda. <img class="wp-image-674910 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-8-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-8-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-8-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lizwe Sweswe Sweswe assumed the role of head coach at rebuilding Castle Lager Premiership side Bulawayo Chiefs while Sibanda was early this unveiled as the FC Platinum Royals guvnor.
