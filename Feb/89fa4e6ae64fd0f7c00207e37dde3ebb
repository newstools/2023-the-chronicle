Clr Mpumelelo Moyo of Ward 26 also unveiled the suburb’s youth centre stand where a vocational centre will be built.
Speaking at the event, the UCCSA Zimbabwe synod secretary Rev Sikhalo Cele said the church has a special role to discourage the youths from engaging in drug and substance abuse as they are future leaders.  He said as a church they realised that substance abuse was one of the leading causes of HIV and Aids.
Rev Cele said once drugs and substance abuse among youths is addressed, a lot of problems will be solved. “We are grateful the community members and the councillor supported us in this outreach. We hope the vocational centre will be built soon,” he said Rev Cele said the campaign will be spread to other suburbs.
“In a few weeks’ time we will be going to Magwegwe suburb where we hope to get the same response,” he said
Cllr Moyo said it is the community’s responsibility to come together to find solutions to challenges such as drug and substance abuse. “Today we unveiled the vocational centre land and I hope the institution will be built soon to train the youths. We want our youths to acquire various skills they will use to earn a living,” said Clr Moyo. A youth who attended the campaign, Miss Sibongile Dube said she was happy the church was not limiting the campaign to their church only. She said she is looking forward to the official opening of the vocational centre.
Another youth Mr Keith Nyoni said having such campaigns are important as they keep youths occupied. He said if youths have nothing to do they end up abusing drugs and engaging in reckless behaviours such as indulging in sex.
Mr Nyoni said involving youths in sports was a great idea as it keeps youths occupied. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-609564" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/sgbv-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/sgbv.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/sgbv-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Last year the church held a march against rape and gender-based violence.
