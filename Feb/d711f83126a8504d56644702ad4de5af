He said they will also be working with the business community in the area to proactively address levels of crime. Rene Burton, speaking on behalf of businesses in the Florida Road precinct, said they were working with police and couldn’t divulge details of the shooting. She said the shooting was an isolated incident which should not blemish the reputation of the area. “Really what we want is for justice to be served efficiently. We want the perpetrators brought to book,” said Burton. “What we want to stress is that this incident has resulted in the loss of two lives. We are co-operating fully with the police. “We want to amplify the message that we will celebrate these two lives.” Burton said she had crossed paths with AKA and remembered him as being passionate. “Our nation has lost a remarkable performer and entertainer.” With regards to Ndaba’s death, Hlomuka said the government was attending to the security issue and the killing of amakhosi. “Again, we urge the communities to work with the police and share information in the two painful incidents. We also convey our heartfelt condolences to the Forbes and Ndaba families,” he said. The government is giving attention to crime hot spots by prioritising resources and the deployment of police, added Hlomuka. – SowetanLive
