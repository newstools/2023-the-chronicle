It’s a cerebral process where the mind has to grasp colours and measurement of the canvas. For one to fully grasp art, they have to sketch their drawings fifty times a day. “This will help their minds to register colours, sizes, distances between objects and also fluency, ” said Mozgaleva-nondo. <img class="wp-image-680191 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ulliana-Mozgaleva-nondo-posing-for-a-group-photo-with-her-arts-class.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ulliana-Mozgaleva-nondo-posing-for-a-group-photo-with-her-arts-class.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Ulliana-Mozgaleva-nondo-posing-for-a-group-photo-with-her-arts-class-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ulliana Mozgaleva-nondo posing for a group photo with her arts class The students welcomed the initiative, citing improvement in their art. Mellisa Mthimkhulu said attending the classes has been an eye-opener for her. “This is my fourth class and I remember the first time I came here, I was totally blank but now, my drawing has improved, “ she said. Tichaona Mudhobhi said he learnt a lot from Mozgaleva-nondo. “I have been coming to Lobengula Youth Centre since I was young under the tutelage of Mehlo Arts’ Mduduzi Moyo. He taught me a lot but I’m glad to have met Ulliana who taught me about the technical side of art where one measures their canvas and uses the mind for effective imagination. She honed our perspective, ” said Mudhobhi. <img class="wp-image-680192 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Tichaona-Mudhobhis-art.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Tichaona-Mudhobhis-art.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Tichaona-Mudhobhis-art-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tichaona Mudhobhi’s art Till March, the gallery will be embarking on a renovation exercise which will see refurbishments done to its ceiling, doors and floors to keep it in mint shape. – @MbuleloMpofu
