The Chronicle   Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Online Reporter HWANGE Local Board has given Empumalanga residents who are still using squat toilets  a month to replace them with sitting toilets  or face a fine of US$20. The local authority’s spokesperson Mr Dumisani Nsingo said last year council called on property owners using squat toilets to replace them with sitting toilets but council has since noted that some residents did not comply with the order. He said council  police and sewer task teams will be moving door to door to identify households still using squat toilets and identified residents will be given a month from February 28 to replace such toilets. “We are hereby advising Empumalanga residents that council police and the sewer task team will be moving door to door in an effort to identify households that are still using squat toilets. Last year council called on property owners using squat toilets to replace them with sitting toilets. However, it has come to our attention that some households are still using squat toilets thus clogging our sewer system, leading to recurrent blockages and bursts. Those found to be using squat toilets will be requested to immediately replace them within a month with effect from February 28,” said Mr Nsingo.@skhumoyo2000.
