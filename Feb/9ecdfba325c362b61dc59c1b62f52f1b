The Chronicle Isaiah 4:1 In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our dis-grace!” NIV First of all, I want you to understand two things: The man who is writing this scripture is under the influence of the Holy Spirit, his name is Prophet Isaiah. As the person writes this book he is saying “in that day,” meaning the day had come. When God is saying “in that day,” He is not talking of only a day, he is talking about a period in that dispensation. Seven women are symbolic to the complete church of God and the husband symbolises Jesus, the “one man among men.” This verse is not talking of the physical man. The Bible says, the seven women (the church) will get hold of him and they will say “we will eat our own food, provide our own clothes, but we want to be called by your name.” If the church remains lukewarm then the scripture in Isaiah 4:1 is slowly being fulfilled. What will happen when it is fulfilled? Will we come to church and say “take us out of poverty or take away our reproach, we only want blessings but we do not want to be called by your name, we must eat our own food,” The “Food” In This Verse Is Talking About Doctrine. What most people do not realise is that when you eat your own food (live according to your own doctrine, not the Word of God) you get what we call spiritual kwashiorkor. There are many Christians who have spiritual kwashiorkor and they do not understand why God is refusing to bless them. They are coming into the house of God with preconceived ideas that they got in the world, yet they just want to be called Christians. A name is just the beginning when you enter Christianity; you are entering the ways of Christianity, which means reading and understanding the Word of God. Living by the statutes, according to the commandments, like living a holy life and tithing. God Bless! -eaglelifeassembly@yahoo.com.
