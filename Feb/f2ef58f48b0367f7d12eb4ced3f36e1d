The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu and Mkhululi Ncube, Chronicle Reporters GOVERNMENT is assisting in the construction of seven schools in Mangwe and Bulilima Districts through devolution funds to help complete projects that were started by local communities some of whose members are in the diaspora. Four of the schools are primary schools while the other three are secondary schools. Primary schools under construction will help ensure that children start their early Childhood Development (ECD) learning at the appropriate age. Government under the Second Republic is prioritising development of school infrastructure to ensure that learners, especially in rural areas have access to quality education. The Government is also capacitating rural schools with computer laboratories. Out of the seven schools that are under construction, five are in Bulilima District and two are in Mangwe District.  Building of the two schools in Mangwe District: Mzila Primary and Greystone Primary started as community initiatives, with Government coming in after locals struggled to mobilise funds. So far $40 million devolution funds have been used towards building Greystone Primary School while $22,7 million has been used at Mzila Primary School. <img class="wp-image-683158 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-25-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Greystone Primary School In Bulilima District, two primary schools: Ndiweni Primary and Goba Primary as well as three secondary schools Tjemahale Secondary, Huwana Secondary, Gwambe Secondary are also being constructed. Most of the funding is coming from the local community, those in the diaspora, Constituency Development Funds (CDF) from parliament and devolution funds from Government, with cement manufacturer PPC Cement donating 150 for construction of Tjemahale Secondary School. Ms Senzeni Mguni from Mzila Village in Mangwe District said the new primary school will cut the distance learners travel to school. “Children from our area have to rely on Tshitshi Primary School which is about six kilometres away. A pupil has to start ECD A at four years. It becomes torture to expect a four-year-old to travel such a long distance to school. That’s why we end up keeping the children at home until they are aged six or seven. Travelling such a distance will still be a burden for them at that age but the situation will be much better,” she said. “This school will really help our children because as it is they hate school as they associate it with the burden of walking long distances. Children will now have a positive mindset towards learning and this will help to improve their performance. We look forward to the opening of this school. The devolution funds have brought hope to us and we are confident that they will ensure timeous completion of the school.” A villager from Khalanyoni area in Ward 16, Mr Bright Khupe said Greystone Primary School will help to ensure that learning is not disrupted for local pupils. He said learners from his area have to cross a stream to get to Mayobodo Primary School and during the rainy season they miss out on lessons as the stream will be flooded. Mangwe Rural District Council chairperson, Sindisiwe Nleya said devolution funds have brought hope to community members as the two primary schools under construction in the district will help to address the problem of overcrowding in existing schools. <img class="wp-image-675057 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Cde-Sindisiwe-Nleya.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Cde-Sindisiwe-Nleya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Cde-Sindisiwe-Nleya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Sindisiwe Nleya Mzila Primary School will benefit five villages while four villages will benefit from construction of Greystone Primary School. Mangwe Rural District Council chief executive officer, Mr Bongani Ngwenya said Mzila and Greystone Primary School projects were initiated by community members but villagers were struggling to mobilise funds leading to council utilising devolution funds on the projects. “Devolution funds have improved council’s service delivery under infrastructure development. The funds have dramatically increased council’s portfolio of social infrastructure development, in particular schools and clinics,” he said. In Bulilima East, five schools are under construction and the community has received permission from Government to build another secondary, Mlomwe Secondary School in Natane ward with the ground breaking ceremony set for March this year. Bulilima East legislator who is also the Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism, and Hospitality Industry Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu said funding is coming from the local community, diaspora, CDF and devolution funds. <img class="wp-image-682863 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/4rt54try5y.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/4rt54try5y.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/4rt54try5y-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu He said PPC Cement has donated cement for the Tjemahale Secondary School building project. “We have three secondary schools being built in the constituency, Tjemahale in Khame, Huwana and Gwambe schools. We started the first two schools in 2018. At Tjemahale secondary we have done a classroom block, cottage and toilets and the school started enrolment this term. Construction continues as we have to add another block ahead of next year to be ready for more learners,” he said. “With Huwana Secondary School, we have finished building the classroom block with final touches being made like putting doors, window panes and floors from there we move to the cottage. We missed the target to have it opened this year but our aim now is to start the foundation for the second block so that next year we start enrolling learners.” He acknowledged the massive support from the diaspora community who are financially supporting the construction work. “For primary schools we have Ndiweni Primary School where we have finished a classroom block with a cottage being built. We also have Goba Primary School which started before I was elected as the legislator for the constituency but it had dragged. “A classroom block has been finished with a cottage being constructed. Our aim is to  reduce the distance being walked by learners and to address the low pass rate challenges,” he said.
