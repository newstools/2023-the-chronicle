SEVERAL local artists have joined the rest of the world in commemorating Valentine’s Day by releasing new love songs.
Each year on the 14th of February music is an essential component as lovers celebrate their love for each other, family, and friends. Not to be left out this year, legendary musician Jeys Marabini released a video for his love song titled Bambolwami, a track on his recently launched album ‘Xola’. “Love is the pillar of any home or household and even outside our marriages and relationships. As human beings we are obligated to love and appreciate each other,” said Marabini.  “And it shouldn’t be on a certain day that people love each other, even within long-distance relationships, love should prevail because sometimes partners learn to live apart because of circumstances but loving each remains possible and important. “Valentine’s Day is just there to emphasise on the significance of love and an opportunity for us to remind our loved ones that we love and cherish them. It’s very important that now and then, we remind those close to us of how much we value them,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-579720 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/love-letters.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/love-letters.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/love-letters-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Other songs released for Valentine’s Day include Kinah the Music’s track titled ‘Valentines in December’, ‘Okuhle’ by Kiros featuring The Shoemaker and ‘Rudo Mwenje’ by Ashleigh Love and Black orient.
