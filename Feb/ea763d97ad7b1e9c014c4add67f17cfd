We look forward to a successful tournament,” said Edwards. The first edition of the Mdula tournament was won by Thorngrove who beat Makokoba Tigers 2-1 in the final at Thorngrove Grounds late last year. The Mdula Football Foundation was established last year with the vision of creating a safe and fun environment for young people to enjoy the beautiful game of football. The director of the foundation is Mduduzi Nkiwane who is based in the United Kingdom. He works together with former Thorngrove Division One player Konson West, the Foundation’s chief executive and former Highlanders player Simba Rusike, Wayne Albertyn, manager Roy Cele and Philip Mutsa Muchirahondo who is the welfare manager. The academy’s main objective is to promote junior football by helping manage other junior teams to make them run smoothly. The foundation does this by firstly sourcing football kits, boots and any necessary football equipment required. Secondly, hosting soccer tournaments and lastly coaching clinics for the diagnosis of problems and training. It runs under the motto “efficiency and professionalism”. -@innocentskizoe
