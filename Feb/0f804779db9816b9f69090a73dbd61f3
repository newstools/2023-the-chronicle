RESERVE Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)’s sole gold buying unit, Fidelity Printers and Refiners, has opened a new gold buying office at Maphisa Business Centre, Matobo District in Matabeleland South as part of its service decentralisation programme. Maphisa is surrounded by gold rich areas such as Kezi, Mangwe, Bulilima and Gwanda. Fidelity said the new buying office at Maphisa will enable it to pay the miners on delivery.  “We have opened a gold buying office at Agribank building at Maphisa. Deliver your gold and get instant cash,” said Fidelity. The establishment of the gold buying centre has been commended by small-scale miners who say this will enhance business convenience and formal gold deliveries unlike in the past when dealers were forced to travel all the way to Bulawayo or Gwanda town.   <img class="wp-image-582519 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-19-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-19-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Untitled-19-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Wellington Takavarasha Zimbabwe Miners Federation CEO Zimbabwe Miners Federation chief executive officer Mr Wellington Takavarasha said Matobo is one of the major producers of gold and the opening of the buying office was a welcome development. “This has brought the service close to the miners in the area who used to travel to either Gwanda or  Bulawayo to sell their gold,” said Mr Takavarasha. Fidelity Printers and Refiners has said it is planning to open more gold buying offices to cut the distances travelled by miners to sell their gold. – @SikhulekelaniM1
