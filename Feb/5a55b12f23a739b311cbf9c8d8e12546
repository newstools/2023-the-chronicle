The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has said rains being received, particularly in the Matabeleland region, have given communities hope of a good harvest and food security. In the past seasons, while most parts of the country received relatively good rains, Matabeleland region was a victim of erratic rainfall patterns.  However, this season, the situation promises to be different as heavy rains are being received across the country. Addressing scores of Zanu-PF supporters who had gathered to receive him at the Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport yesterday, President Mnangagwa said the rains have made a lot of people happy. <img class="wp-image-683147 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-22.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-22.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-22-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> PRESIDENT Mnangagwa addresses party supporters at the Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport yesterday while Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga and Bulawayo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Judith Ncube listen on The President arrived in Bulawayo ahead of the National Youth Day commemorations to be held at Lupane State University in Lupane, Matabeleland North, where he will deliver the key note address.

The President arrived to a thunderous welcome from the party’s supporters who chanted “ED Pfee” as he waved a fist, the Zanu-PF way of greeting them. President Mnangagwa briefly addressed the party supporters telling them of his African Union Heads of State Summit trip to Ethiopia.  “We came back yesterday (Sunday). We were in Ethiopia for the African Union Heads of States meeting. A meeting for elders; I’m also an elder. So, the rest of Africa, all the Heads of State of the 54 countries of Africa were assembled in Addis Ababa for the Summit of Heads of State and this is done every year. It is closing today, but I came back yesterday evening because there is a meeting tomorrow. I want to attend the meeting in Lupane that is why I’m here,” said President Mnangagwa. He said he was humbled to be received by jubilant party supporters. President Mnangagwa said the rains that have been received are giving people hope, hence the supporters’ excitement was justified. “I’m so pleased that you have come here to receive me, I feel very humbled. Thank you very much. I think the reason (you are happy) is that there have been good rains in Matabeleland. That is why everybody is very happy. As we were flying, the whole area is green, green and green. So, we want to thank God,” said President Mnangagwa. The President’s sentiments on the rains come as Bulawayo’s supply dams that have been drastically low since the start of the rainy season have started improving. According to statistics released by the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) the city’s six supply dams have received a 16 percent increase in water levels since January. President Mnangagwa’s Government has rolled massive infrastructure programmes in Matabeleland region since he came to power in 2017 covering water, agriculture among others. One of the signature programmes is the Lake Gwayi-Shangani which will become the third largest inland water body after Tugwi-Mukosi and Lake Mutirikwi, both in Masvingo Province. The big dam is part of the National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project, an idea which was conceived over a century ago and has only been turned into reality by the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa. Lake Gwayi-Shangani is expected to provide a permanent water solution for Bulawayo and the Matabeleland region. The project is a significant milestone that will transform the lives of many communities living along the pipeline from the dam to Bulawayo as irrigation schemes will be established taking advantage of the abundant water that will be pumped through the pipeline. — @nqotshili
