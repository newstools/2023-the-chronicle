The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN gaffer Taurai Mangwiro orchestrated Botswana Premier Soccer League defending champions Gaborone United’s first defeat of the season as his Orapa United clobbered the title holders 4-2 on Saturday at the Botswana National Stadium. Playing away in Gaborone, Mangwiro’s side brought the champions’ 28-match unbeaten run in the league to an end. The Botswana champions’ last league defeat was on February 19, 2022 when they went down 1-0 away against Township Rollers. Before their defeat to Mangwiro’s side, Gaborone United had registered 11 wins and five draws in their 2022/23 season’s unbeaten run.  For Orapa United who have registered 12 wins, two draws and three defeats, the victory meant that they are now unbeaten in nine games. Mangwiro was ecstatic with the victory, saying going into the break level at 1-1 gave them a sense of belief. “What I think was the turning point was our equaliser which I think gave us hope going forward. It was always going to be difficult had we gone to the half-time trailing but the equaliser gave us belief and we came up with corrective measures at half-time. “In the second-half the boys needed to keep believing, needed to do better in terms of ball management and decision making. In the first-half we were not good in those aspects. We had to control the midfield, something we didn’t do well in the first-half. The boys took heed of our instructions and we managed to win,” said Mangwiro. Zimbabwean utility player Tapiwa Nyamanjiva was on target for Orapa United who got their other goals from Omatatla Kebatho and a brace from Lemogang Maswena. Besides Nyamanjiva, the other Zimbabwean players who featured in Orapa United’s victory were Anelka Chivandire and Wilfred Muvirimi. <img class="wp-image-665316 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-71-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-71-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Untitled-71-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Orapa United Orapa United’s win left them and Gaborone United trailing leaders Jeanne Galaxy by five points. Jwaneng Galaxy, home to former Highlanders pair of Nqobizitha Masuku and their player of the moment Daniel Msendami beat Security Systems 3-1 to maintain their 17-game 2022/23 season’s unbeaten run. Jwaneng Galaxy’s 43 points are from 13 wins and four draws. Masuku came in the 46th minute as Jwaneng Galaxy were leading 3-0 and wanted to protect their points while Msendani did not play. Jwaneng Galaxy coach Morena Ramoreboli said: “We knew we were playing a tricky side and the second-half was going to be difficult. After getting three goals in the first-half we had to protect our lead, make sure we close shop and be defensively steady. Our opponents had five offensive players, closed the pockets we were hoping for and that is why we had to introduce another defensive midfielder (Masuku) to contain them,” Ramoreboli said. — @ZililoR
