NEWLY promoted Gweru-based Premiership side Sheasham will get another test of topflight challenge when they play host to Black Rhinos at Ascot Stadium today. By playing Black Rhinos, The Construction Boys as Sheasham are affectionately known, will be “killing” two birds with one stone as they fine tune their players while at the same time introducing the players to the Gweru community. Last weekend, Sheasham lost 1-0 to Dynamos at the same venue. The Sheasham coach John Nyikadzino said despite the loss, the match gave his charges a good run as they continue to work on their game time. DeMbare’s captain Frank Makarati scored the solitary goal.  Happy Dziwa, Sheasham’s vice-president said the pre-season matches that they are lining up in Gweru are part of their drive for fan engagement. “We value our fans and as brand Sheasham we are taking advantage of these friendly matches that the coaches are using to check progress of their players, to engage fans. Its key from an administrative point of view to grow our fan base. We’re appealing to the Gweru community to come in their numbers and rally behind the boys, they must come and see how their Premiership representatives look like,” said Dziwa. He said the team will play two games, with the first starting at 1pm and the second at 3pm. The ambitious Gweru side who are sponsored by Sheasham Construction, have been busy on the transfer market and have beefed up their squad with at least 12 players as they seek to stay longer in the topflight. <img class="wp-image-453236 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Black-Rhinos.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Black-Rhinos.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/Black-Rhinos-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Black Rhinos Ex-Hwange and ZPC Kariba goalkeeper Future Sibanda, the pair of Tichaona Macheka and Tatenda Makurumidze who were signed from Caps United, Tafadzwa Marira (Tenax) and Munyaradzi Chirwa who joined the club from relegated Whawha, are some of the players with Premiership experience that have been signed by Sheasham. Nyikadzino said he is looking forward to a physical and tactical encounter against the army’s flagship Premiership side.
“Dynamos gave us a good run and it was our first training game. When we play Black Rhinos, all the players will have game time because we are playing two games. I’m confident that Black Rhinos just like us are going to give it their all as we continue to fine tune our pre-season training,” said Nyikadzino. <img class="alignnone wp-image-678255 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/John-Nyikadzino-Sheasham-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/John-Nyikadzino-Sheasham-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/John-Nyikadzino-Sheasham--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Black Rhinos, who lost several players including Soccer Star of the Year finalist Eli Ilunga, Peace Makaha, Dennis Dauda, Tawanda Chisi and Gareth Madake, managed to recruit a number of footballers from fellow army sides Tongogara, Cranborne Bullets and Chapungu. – @ZililoR.
