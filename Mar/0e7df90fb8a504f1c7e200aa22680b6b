The Chronicle God’s will is to empower women and use them mightily in the house of God and pour out His abundant and immeasurable anointing upon them, in order to break and trample every stronghold of the devil and yoke of the enemy throughout nations and across continents. Women must work hard, study and further themselves. God desires to see them rise up and take their rightful positions in His Kingdom. As the Bible states in… Jeremiah 29 vs 11
“For I know the plans I have for you, “says the Lord, “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” NLT  God has given this promise unto every woman without being biased, without favouritism and limitations and He wants women to know that every believer is a child of God and He is prepared to use them regardless of gender. When it comes to winning souls and kingdom anointing power, God does not look at a person’s sex or gender, but He looks at the willingness and availability of their heart. He is looking for hearts that are loyal and fully committed to Him. If a woman is faithful and loyal to God, He will empower her and use her mightily, even more than a man. Behind the conversion of the Samaritan woman, Jesus could see an effective soul winner who was going to leave her water pot and go and testify of Him to the multitudes and win the whole city to Christ. When God looks at us, He sees beyond what people see. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-605191" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Walking-In-Spirit-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> 2 Chronicles 16 vs 9
“For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to strengthen and show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are loyal and fully committed to Him” NKJV
As long as a woman avails herself to Gods work, whole-hearted and without compromise, God will take that woman into His powerful and anointed hands and cause that woman to turn the world around, bringing thousands to Christ before the eyes of men.
Romans 2 vs 11
For God is not a respecter of persons KJV
God is not like man, there is no favouritism with Him. His ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts. He does not look at the outward appearance but the heart.
