The event also coincided with a clean-up campaign that saw church members and residents picking up litter at the local shopping centre where the church also donated three bins. The drug awareness campaign was targeting mostly the youths in the community. <img class="alignnone wp-image-688906 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ghjjki.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ghjjki.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ghjjki-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Following President Mnangagwa’s strong directive for churches to complement Government efforts in the fight against drugs and substance abuse among youths, the SDA Church has taken up the challenge to lead from the forefront in raising public awareness against societal ills such as illicit drug dealing. In an interview during the march, Mahatshula West SDA Church pastor, Khonzile Khumalo, said they recognised the need to work together with the community in line with the Government’s expectation of the church as a symbol of good values.  He said raising awareness against drug abuse was critical in empowering youths to make informed decisions to quit and avoid illicit drugs. “As the church, we believe God can change the life of a person regardless of their works. Youths and other individuals should be taught to live a life that is free from drugs for us to have a productive and    healthy community,” said Pastor Khumalo. <img class="alignnone wp-image-688893 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ggghjujkikij.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ggghjujkikij.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ggghjujkikij-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Moreso, the nation is striving to reach vision 2030 that needs capacitated youths. We also carried out a clean-up campaign because we understand that cleanliness is next to godliness. “We saw it fit to donate three bins that we had to put around Mahatshula West Shopping Centre so that we live in a clean environment as much as it is the place where we worship God. Once there is a disease outbreak in the area, we might get affected so prevention is better than cure.”  The police have already intensified their operations against illicit drugs and substance abuse with over 3 600 cumulative arrested so far countrywide. Bulawayo East legislator Mr Ilos Nyoni, paid tribute to the SDA Church for organising the clean-up and anti-drug awareness programme. “We cannot have a productive community without the youths changing their ways,” he said. -@NomqheleC
