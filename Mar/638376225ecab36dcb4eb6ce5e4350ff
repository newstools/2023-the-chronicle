The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TALK of Mpopoma High School, talk of success. Back in the day, it would have been an educational success but the school has over the years become a school of sporting excellence. Popular for its strength in producing “smart” students, the school has also earned its stripes in the sporting scene. Just before Covid-19 struck and disrupted sporting activities, Mpopoma High School had already outlined its ambitious plan to conquer all school competitions. <img class="wp-image-602143 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-39-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Covid-19 It was a well-thought-out strategy that was long in the pipeline and was about to make a sublime impact on the sporting scene. The school posts A-grade records in national examinations and is now doing as much on the sporting field too. The school is known to enrol nerds but it is also home to those who are pretty much gifted in the sport, it seems. Thanks to its vibrant policy of pulling resources towards sports development, the school is now a reference point when talking about sports excellence in the country. The past decade has seen Mpopoma rising from its slumber and producing quality sportspersons who have earned medals in athletics and other sports codes. With support from the school’s executive led by Christopher Dube, Mpopoma High school’s prowess in sports has left many in awe and envy. The marvel at hard work put into practice and competitions deserve mention. Other schools in the city want to follow suit. History has it that the school contributes a significant number of athletes to the Bulawayo provincial team. It is a given that one or two Mpopoma protégés are selected for the national team. As many medals and trophies are hung and displayed in the school’s cabinet. <img class="alignnone wp-image-686385 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-11-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-11-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-11-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> At the Bulawayo National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) track and field inter-districts athletics competition at White City Stadium in 2017, the school collected 38 medals, of which 16 were gold, while the next school Northlea High only managed five gold medals. The feat saw the school provide 21 athletes to Team Bulawayo for the national Nash meet that was held in Chinhoyi. The Chinhoyi competition was also used to select a team that will go on to represent Zimbabwe at the Confederation of School Sports Associations of Southern Africa (Cossasa) track and field tournament. Five athletes from the school made it into the national squad. Tatenda Ndlovu, Linnett Dhliwayo, and Jenipher Tembo were chosen for the 1 500m, 800m, javelin, high jump, long jump, and triple jump in the girls’ Under-15, while Brian Ndlovu and Ronald Muchichwa will carry the country’s hopes in the boys’ Under-15 high jump and 400m events respectively. In 2019 their girl’s football team won the Copa Coca-Cola national championships. In the same year, Mpopoma went on to overcome Pamushana High School in the Stella Tanganda Netball tourney. Pamushana had dominated the competition for years. The school also did well in volleyball. Unfortunately, Covid-19 struck and seemed to threaten the school vision which was well on course. However, if the school’s recent performance at the just-ended Mzilikazi district athletics competition this past week is anything to go by then the school is still to achieve more. Mpopoma High collected a massive 43 gold medals, 23 silver, and 15 bronze medals. Sikhulile was the next best school with 16 gold, 14 silver, and 15 bronze medals.  “When Covid-19 came we were on the right track in terms of performing and doing well in various sporting disciplines. Now that school sports stopped for close to three years we were not sure of what to expect. “However, the results from the track and field events show that our vision to conquer the nation through sport is still in line,” said Mpopoma High sports director James Rugwevera. The big question is what has been Mpopoma High’s secret to all the success on the sporting field? “What we have done is simple. We have come up with an academy for every sporting discipline where we have athletes training and perfecting their skills. What we have achieved with the athletics team is just evidence of how training and preparation can do. “The moment we were notified school sport was coming back we began training. Some doubted what we were doing but the results are there for all to see. We hope to have some of these athletes who have made the district team make it to the provincial team and later team Zimbabwe. We are not stopping till we conquer Zimbabwe through sport,” said Rugwevera. One thing is for sure, Mpopoma is building a reputation as a sporting powerhouse in Bulawayo and their dominance is being felt. –@innocentskizoe
