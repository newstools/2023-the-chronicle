“God is with us Zimbabweans because he availed to us minerals like lithium which are on demand globally. Our erstwhile detractors imposed sanctions on us thinking that our economy will collapse, but our loving God blessed us with minerals which they don’t have. “They are now envying us, but we are saying no exports of unprocessed minerals. We want to grow our mining economy which is now at US$12 billion under the Second Republic,” said President Mnangagwa.  He said despite the brain drain being caused by some Western countries recruiting professionals from the country, Zimbabwe will double its efforts to train its manpower. “Our professionals are being recruited in their numbers by other countries because they respect our high quality education. Recently Vice-President (Chiwenga) was in Switzerland for a global health summit and the World Health Organisation (WHO) acknowledged the brain drain being suffered by Zimbabwe and promised to assist us in training more manpower. “We will double our efforts in training our medical professionals. They can recruit them today, but we know that tomorrow they will come back home and invest in their country. Home is always home. We will welcome back all returning residents with open hands and avail them all the opportunities they want to better their lives.” The President said the Second Republic introduced the Education 5.0 Policy to ensure that young professionals acquire the necessary skills especially in sciences to develop the country. “We should all be patriotic and proud of our country. You cannot expect to behave like a person in California in the United States when you are here in Bocha,” he said. President Mnangagwa added: “We are preparing to welcome back our returning residents from South Africa. I told my South African counterpart, President Ramaphosa not to lose sleep over that issue as some of the people in that country do not want Zimbabweans there. <img class="size-large wp-image-687708" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ghse4trhfbn-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ghse4trhfbn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/ghse4trhfbn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangangwa welcomed by Johane Marange Apostolic church and Zanu-PF supporters “We will render them all the necessary support to finding their footing in their motherland. We are setting up a screening centre for all returning residents at Beitbridge. No one among the returning residents will become a destitute. Statistics availed to us show that we have more people coming back to Zimbabwe from South Africa than leaving.” On food security, he said the 2022/23 farming season is promising to be an excellent one, with a bumper harvest being reported across the country. “As we were flying here we realised that there is lush green everywhere. I asked Chief Marange on the food situation here and he said all those who planted something will harvest unlike in previous years. This is impressive. As Government, we will continue supporting you with all the necessary inputs and logistics. “I was in Matabeleland recently and the traditional chiefs there are over the moon with the support we are giving them as they are also anticipating bumper harvests. We now have irrigation facilities to ensure food security. We are now wheat-sufficient as a nation because of the Second Republic’s policies. This will be the norm going forward. We have waved hunger and food insecurity a permanent goodbye,” he said. Turning to the forthcoming harmonised elections, President Mnangagwa hinted that they will be held in August.
“This year we will have our harmonised elections sometime in August, but I will tell you the actual date later. We should all vote peacefully. I was impressed with the turnout I have witnessed and I will go back to Harare with peace of mind,” he said. For the boarding facility, President Mnangagwa pledged US$100 000, 12×30-tonnes truckloads of cement and food for the construction work. “I was here when the first brick of the primary school was laid. I was back when the first brick of the high school was laid. I am back again for the groundbreaking ceremony of the boarding project. This shows how deep my relationship is with this church. “I want to salute the church leader, High Priest Nimrod Taguta for carrying the torch from his late father, High Priest Noah Taguta. I will always continue supporting such projects because Government alone should not be left to build schools. Churches, companies and individuals should also come on board because we want more schools to be constructed across the country. <img class="size-large wp-image-687726" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/frwsrgbxf-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/frwsrgbxf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/frwsrgbxf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa dance flanked by Mutumwa Nimrod Taguta(left) and Jojane Marange Apostolic Church spokesperson Nyasha Marange (right) “I am happy with the strides being made by the church in constructing schools.
