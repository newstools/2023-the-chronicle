Bulawayo’s oldest township, Makokoba, is steeped in history and culture. Its name is derived from the actions of Mr Fallon, the Native Commissioner, who used to walk around with a stick. The name comes from the word ukukhokhoba which in the local Ndebele language means “bending and walking with a stick.” <img class="size-large wp-image-688502" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjythjtghn-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjythjtghn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjythjtghn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late couple, Lenny Gwata and Beater Mangethe with son Leslie Makokoba is famous for many historical monuments such as Stanley Square and Stanley Hall, Amakhosi Cultural Centre, and Big Bhawa. It is also where you can find arguably the first flea market in Zimbabwe, eMkambo, where all sorts of goodies can be found, including traditional medicine. <img class="size-large wp-image-422665" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Peter-Ndlovu-680x382.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Peter-Ndlovu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Peter-Ndlovu-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Peter Ndlovu Makokoba is a melting pot of cultures, as many people from different tribes and ethnicities have lived and still live in the suburb. The township had, at its birth, two distinct areas of residence: the Bulawayo Municipal Compound (BMC) closer to the white Bulawayo to the east, and the other section, to the west, housed other workers and people who were part of the residents of Ndebele KoBulawayo. Makokoba has also been the birthplace of many entrepreneurs, artists, and musicians who have contributed to the country’s economic and cultural development. The women who made money through brewing traditional beer are also worth mentioning. At the time, city council had not ventured into the lucrative traditional beer brewing industry. However, the city council got into the business of brewing traditional beer and constructed their first brewery in 1912 close to present-day MaKhumalo Beer Garden. The women were elbowed out. Later the brewery was relocated to Steeldale where it still is today. <img class="size-large wp-image-688506" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/uiolkhj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/uiolkhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/uiolkhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Cde Jason ‘Ziyaphapha’ Moyo One of Makokoba’s most famous sons is the late Cde Jason “Ziyaphapha” Moyo, a national hero who was the second vice-president of the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (Zapu). His residence, house number 141, 10th Street in Makokoba, is still standing today. Cde Moyo died on January 22, 1977, in Zambia after a parcel bomb explosion. He had just returned from Mozambique where he had met the late former President, Robert Mugabe, to discuss the integration of Zanu and Zapu. The veteran nationalist was reburied at the National Heroes’ Acre on August 11, 1981.  Another famous son of Makokoba is Peter Ndlovu and his two siblings, Madinda and the late Adam. While the world gave him the nickname Nsukuzonke, his family calls him Maqhatsha. The three brothers were blessed with incredible ability and complemented each other beautifully each time they ran onto the pitch of any stadium around the country donning the black and white-striped jerseys of their beloved Highlanders Football Club. They entertained football fans countrywide with their fancy footwork combined with speed and amazing goal-scoring abilities, which established their legacy in the local game. One of the brothers, Marko Dube, is now the Bosso 90 manager. His leadership skills and qualities have had some people suggesting that he tries running for the Highlanders executive post position. <img class="size-large wp-image-688509" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gyjtyre-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gyjtyre.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gyjtyre-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nobuhle Mgwaqo Footballers from Makokoba are far too many to mention, it may actually need Part 2 of this column, specifically for footballers, a number that can actually result in three Premier Soccer League teams being formed. Former Soccer Star of the Year and top gunman Zenzo Moyo, Thabani Moyo, the late Lenny Gwata, Mangethe’s husband, Matambanashe Sibanda, the late Benjamin Nkonjera, Gift Lunga Snr, are some of the yesteryear greats to emerge from Makokoba. Diminutive midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku, Godfrey “Baba Jukwa” Makaruse, who, perhaps unknown to Highlanders fans, has a twin sister. United States of America-based Teenage Hadebe is also from Makokoba, so is former Zimbabwe Saints and Hwange striker Sisa Mandala Moyo. <img class="size-large wp-image-688513" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gfhujyuj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gfhujyuj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gfhujyuj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bongie Diamond Junior football in Zimbabwe cannot be complete, in fact cannot even start without the mention of the man himself, straight from Kezi, Albert Dube, popularly known as Ali Baba. Dube is credited with moulding a number of footballers who went on to shine at club and international level. She was 32 years old when she breathed her last, songstress and actor, Beater Mangethe is rightfully regarded as Makokoba’s queen. Her family house is just a few metres from the famous Stanley Square, where Zapu was born from trade unionism. <img class="size-large wp-image-688515" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/jukjiolj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/jukjiolj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/jukjiolj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Percy Makombe Veteran journalist Percy Makombe, now working for Linda Gates Foundation, is a Makokoba boy, so is Skyz Metro’s Ms Diamond, uBongie, Sibonginkosi Maphosa. She is a Tsholotsho girl also. UMthunywa publication’s senior reporter Nobuhle Mgwaqo is neighbours with Zemura and Mandala in 6th street. Another media personality, the one and only Cde Phil, a master ED (events director) hails from Makokoba. <img class="size-large wp-image-688518" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjyj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjyj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjyj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Phil “I remember waking up to the sweet smell of fat cooks in gogo’s kitchen and being sent to go to buy fresh milk and lacto from the Dairibord salesman popularly known as uMasawa. The township was not just a dwelling place but brought a sense of belonging, everyone was family. We shared almost everything, even television sets. Children from the neighbourhood would gather at home around 4pm just to watch the black and white television. “The now eNsimbini in Makokoba used to be a playground where we used to find swings, slides and all children will head there to play up until you were called for that hot Kango plate of sadza with Lacto and a spoonful of white sugar around lunch hour,” Mgwaqo tells Saturday Chronicle. <img class="size-large wp-image-688521" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhtyhjju-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhtyhjju.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhtyhjju-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ali Baba Dube Renowned author and screen writer, Raisedon Baya calls eMakokoba home same as other legendary artistes like Fortune Ruzungunde, Zenzo Nyathi, Alois Moyo, Richard Masuku, Lewis Ndlovu, and Pedzisayi Sithole among a bus full of them who, like footballers, may need a separate column. Interestingly, Makokoba has no school, primary or secondary, named after it despite its historical being. It has three primary schools, one of them named after another suburb, Lobengula Primary School. The two other schools are St Patrick’s and Mckeurtan. <img class="size-large wp-image-688524" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjyiu-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjyiu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yhjyiu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Raisedon Baya It is also home to the long-distance bus terminus, eRenkini as well as the famous Blue Lagoon, owned by the late Vice-President Nkomo. Legend has it that the late former President Robert Mugabe’s Blue Roof house was actually an inspiration from Blue Lagoon. So long folks, next week we visit eMadonkini, Old Pumula. Do you know any famous son or daughter from there? I have the legendary late jazz musician Dorothy Masuka, our Assistant Editor Nduduzo Tshuma, veteran journalist Njabulo Ncube and another scribe Sibongumusa Dlodlo.
