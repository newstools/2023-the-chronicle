The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Business Reporter AGRICULTURE experts have urged farmers to apply top-dressing fertiliser to all crops that were planted in January 2023 as well as take protective measures against diseases in order to boost yields. As rains continue to pound most parts of the country, farmers are optimistic about a good harvest this year. Government expects increased farm output to anchor economic growth while trimming grain imports. Enhancing food security is a priority and Zimbabwe has already surpassed the US$8,2 billion agriculture industry target that the country intended to achieve by 2025, underpinned by the country’s National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). <img class="wp-image-602851 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-28-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Money – Image taken from Pixabay In an interview, the acting provincial director for Agricultural Rural Development and Advisory Services in Bulawayo and Matabeleland North, Mr Dumisani Nyoni, said the good rains countrywide are expected to boost yields and urged farmers to take measures that will ensure their crops thrive. “I want to encourage all farmers that planted their crops in January this year to start applying top dressing fertiliser, be it maize, sorghum, or finger millet,” he said. “Farmers should take this time to utilise the current moisture and apply fertiliser to boost their crops. “This will also boost their output come harvest time and we urge farmers to monitor their crops, especially for the fall armyworm, which attacks crops at this stage.  “With great care, farmers can win against the fall armyworm and it is very important to start looking for pesticides,” said Mr Nyoni. He also urged farmers to look after crops that were planted at the start of the cropping season until harvest time to ensure there are no losses. Zimbabwe requires about 2,2 million tonnes of maize for human and livestock consumption and this year targets three million tonnes, which will position the country as a significant player in grain production in the region. In Matabeleland North Province, 165 000 farmers received inputs under Intwasa/Pfumvudza while 130 000 farmers in Matabeleland South benefited under the programme. <img class="wp-image-512823 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Intwasa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Intwasa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/Intwasa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Intwasa/Pfumvudza mode of farming Intwasa is a concept aimed at climate-proofing agriculture by adopting conservation farming techniques and involves the use of small plots and applying the correct agronomic practices for higher returns.
