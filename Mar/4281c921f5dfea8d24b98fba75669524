Murray Goodwin was the star with the ball for Zimbabwe as he finished with figures of 3/31 in 3.5 overs as they struggled to contain the Black Caps’ batters. John Rennie, Michael Van Staden, Garry Spence and Brian Goodwin all took one wicket each for Zimbabwe. New Zealand opener, Andrew Hore produced a fine innings with the bat, scoring 114 runs off 90 balls while Adrian Dale scored a half century, finishing on 68 runs off 76 balls. Murray Goodwin also top scored for Zimbabwe with a 44-ball 34 runs while Kelly Bennett and Van Staden scored 16 and 10 runs respectively to be the only Zimbabwean batters to cross double figures.
