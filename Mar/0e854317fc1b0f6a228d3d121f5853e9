The city council and Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) have been engaged in legal battles over the ownership of the power station with the local authority claiming that the power utility was legally its tenant. Several years ago ZPC emerged with its set of title deeds, which saw them even making moves to demolish two of the cooling towers at the power station. The power utility said the iconic cooling towers had outlived their lifespan. It was not clear how the ZPC got to have the title deeds as the power station was constructed and fell under the jurisdiction of the local authority until 1987 when Zesa was given the sole mandate of power generation in the country, taking over from local authorities.
BCC has vowed that it will only be able to give ZPC the title deeds after the power utility pays them royalties of US$60 million.
