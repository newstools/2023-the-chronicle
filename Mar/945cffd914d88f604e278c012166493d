Leading by four points, the Hornets will fancy their chances when they go head to head against Old Miltonians (OMs) who have only managed to win one match so far this season. The match between the two will be the last of the day. Western Suburbs Academy will face a tough challenge when they play against third-placed Raging Bulls in what promises to be the match of the day as both teams will be eyeing victory to close the season on a high note.  Bulldogs will play against Highlanders while struggling Plumtree Buffaloes will face Matabeleland Select as the curtains come down on the league, which was the first tournament of the local rugby calendar. The rugby development skills programme for children as has happened in the past, will take place in the morning before the start of the league matches. The initiative is open to all children aged between nine and 13.
Schools and parents are therefore encouraged to bring their children to learn from the best coaches in the city. <img class="wp-image-560818 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Gilbert-Nyamutsamba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Gilbert-Nyamutsamba.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/Gilbert-Nyamutsamba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gilbert Nyamutsamba The coaches in charge of developing the budding stars are Gilbert Nyamutsamba, Busani Ncube, George Mukorera and Ruben Kumpasa.
