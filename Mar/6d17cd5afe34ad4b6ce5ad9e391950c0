BULAWAYO Chiefs Football Club coach Lizwe Sweswe says the season’s opener, the Castle Challenge Cup against league champions FC Platinum, will give them a clear view of their state of readiness for the championship. The two clubs will face off on Saturday at Mandava Stadium, with FC Platinum playing in their fourth Castle Challenge Cup while Bulawayo Chiefs are making a maiden appearance. Sweswe, who led FC Platinum to the 2019 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title before leaving the Zvishavane side in October 2020 to join Talen Vision FC in the Zifa Southern Region Division One Soccer League side, will face his former paymasters for the first time.  “I think what is exciting for both teams is that they will use the competition to assess their readiness for the season. It’s one game where we will see how far we are in terms of being ready for the season. “I also believe that facing my former employers is something that might inspire fans to come and watch the game. I’m not under any pressure at all that I’m facing FC Platinum and the key thing is to see how ready we’re as a team for the 2023 season,” said Sweswe. Besides Sweswe, two players, striker Perfect Chikwende and defender William Stima will face their former pay masters. Chikwende left Bulawayo Chiefs to join the league champions in January, with Stima, who was dumped by FC Platinum reuniting with Sweswe at Amakhosi Amahle. Meanwhile, the Premier Soccer League has spiced up the competition for fans by reducing gate charges. <img class="wp-image-682127 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fddffdxccc.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fddffdxccc.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/fddffdxccc-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Castle Challenge Cup The cheapest ticket will be US$2 for the rest of the ground with fans who will watch from the VIP set to pay US$5. Reduction of the gate charges is likely to draw a big crowd. Traditionally, the PSL charges US$3 for the rest of the ground. The Castle Challenge Cup, whose inauguration was in 2017 features Castle Lager Premiership champions and Chibuku Super Cup winners. Bulawayo Chiefs earned the Castle Challenge Cup ticket against four-time Premiership champions after beating Herentals 1-0 courtesy of an Arthur Musiyiwa strike. Sadly, Musiyiwa will not play in the Castle Challenge Cup as he has joined Dynamos. With the last Castle Challenge Cup played at Barbourfields Stadium in March 2020, the PSL decided to move this year’s edition to Mandava. FC Platinum beat Highlanders 2-0 to lift the 2020 edition which had a $400 000 winners’ prize with Bosso taking home $250 000. <img class="wp-image-637645 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-100-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-100-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-100-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> FC Platinum FC Platinum have dominated the Castle Challenge Cup, winning all the editions. The Zvishavane side beat Harare City 2-1 in the inaugural edition and retained the trophy in 2018 with a 2-0 win against Triangle United. The Castle Challenge Cup was not held in 2019 as the PSL resolved to have the competition being played before the start of the season, hence the 2020 edition that featured FC Platinum and Highlanders. Bulawayo Chiefs are FC Platinum’s bogey side and will hope to spring a shocker against the league champions.. — @ZililoR
