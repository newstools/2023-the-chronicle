If the boys continue with the team unity, playing together as a team, I think we will go far,” said Phiri. <img class="wp-image-686688 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-66.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-66.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-66-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ethan Ferguson is presented with his award At the end of the month, the city is set to host a schools rugby festival at the city’s ceremonial home of rugby, Hartsfield Rugby Grounds, from March 31 to April 1.
