The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter TRACY Phiri is a woman on a mission. A born perfectionist, she has dedicated all her life to sport. She has methodically gone through hurdles that would make a lesser person throw in the towel. Her life is a story of an inspirational journey that catapulted her to being one of the top sports administrators in the country. Phiri is a qualified teacher, certified World Athletics Coach, certified Basketball Coach and official. She is also a holder of the International Tchoukball Federation FITB coaching licence. Tchoukball is a little-known sport that is rapidly gaining popularity in the country. It is an indoor team sport developed in the 1970s by Swiss biologist Hermann Brandt, who was concerned about the number of injuries in sport at the time. <img class="wp-image-686407 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-14-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-14-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-14-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tracey Phiri As part of an educational study, he wanted to create a sport that reduced injuries, was not aggressive between players and enabled people of all shapes, sizes, genders, cultures, and backgrounds to play together. Phiri’s love for sport started during her school days and from that tender age, she decided to concentrate her energy on being the best at various disciplines. Her exploits have earned her the description “most versatile female sports administrator” in the country. She is a World Junior Championship medalist — she won silver at the game in Melbourne Australia in 1999. 24 years later, Phiri plays basketball in the Bulawayo Basketball League but most of her energy is channelled to administration. “As an athlete I excelled at Northlea High School that is where I fell in love with sport. I was at the school under the leadership of Njabulo Nkomazana and Jonah Vuma. I did diving, swimming, athletics and basketball. I went for the World Junior Championships in Melbourne Australia as an Under-20 and l got a silver medal in diving.  “I was able to move from High School and went to Hillside Teachers’ College where I majored in physical education and sport. I have always been a sports person. I have done youth exchange programmes in Sweden and in Kenya. After those programmes I ventured into full time teaching and administration,” said Phiri. Phiri’s rise has not been a walk in the park. “As a woman I found it difficult to rise up the ranks. Because it’s a male-dominated terrain you encounter loads of frustration as a woman when you want to rise because even today there are men who feel threatened by women who want to rise. “Some consciously make efforts to pull you down by underrating you so one needs to have a strong character. I have had some nasty encounters and challenges but that has made me stronger and helped me achieve my goals,” said Phiri. <img class="alignnone wp-image-686408 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-15-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-15-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-15-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She is presently studying for an MSc in Sports Science and Coaching with the National University of Science and Technology having completed her Honours in Sports Science and coaching with the same university in 2015. Diploma in Education majoring in Physical education. World athletics Level 1 and 2.
Phiri says she is driven by a strong passion to develop sport at the grassroots level. “I am an innovative team player. My sports science background has helped me to incorporate innovative and modern methods in working with various athletes. I am very much keen to develop athletes from grassroots levels going up,” she said.  — @innocentskizoe
