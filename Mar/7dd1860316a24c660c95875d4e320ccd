SIX armed men raided a Mukuru money transfer outlet in Silobela in Midlands Province and handcuffed a cashier and security guard manning the booth at gunpoint before they got away with US$1 800, R7 800 and cellphones. After the raid, the suspects sped off in their getaway car, a Toyota Wish.
Midlands Police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the incident, which happened on Tuesday at around midday.  “The robbers masqueraded as genuine clients and joined the queue pretending to be waiting for their turn to be served. Three of them entered the booth and produced pistols before they ordered all clients in the booth to lie down,” he said. Inspector Mahoko said the gang threatened to shoot the teller before ordering him to surrender all the money and out of fear, he complied.
The robbers then used the security guard’s handcuffs to jointly cuff both the guard and the teller. “They then ransacked the booth and took the money and two cellphones before speeding off in a Toyota Wish towards Nkayi,” said the police spokesperson. <img class="wp-image-633829 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-11.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-11.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-1-copy-11-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Mukuru Bureau De Change He said no arrests have been made and they are appealing to anyone with information that could lead to the suspects’ arrest to contact any nearest police station.
