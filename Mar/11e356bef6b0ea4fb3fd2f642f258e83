The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief GOVERNMENT has disbursed $1,6 billion devolution funds in Matabeleland South province since 2019 resulting in the implementation of key service delivery projects. The devolution funds have assisted local authorities in the province to fulfil their obligation of ensuring improved access to social amenities through development of key infrastructure such as clinics, classroom blocks, roads, bridges, street lighting among other facilities. Social amenities and infrastructure development are some of the major pillars of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). The overarching goal of the NSD1 is to ensure high, accelerated, inclusive and sustainable economic growth as well as socio-economic transformation and development as Government moves to transform the country into an upper middle-income society by 2030. Government led by President Mnangagwa saw it prudent to operationalise the devolution concept as enshrined in the Constitution, resulting in five percent of fiscal disbursement from Treasury being made to local authorities. The funds have transformed several districts in the Matabeleland region in particular and the country in general, as the Second Republic steps up the inclusive developmental philosophy of leaving no one and no place behind. Councils have managed to purchase service vehicles and capacitate staff with equipment, which has helped to improve service delivery.  Schools have been constructed in several communities across the province thereby reducing distances walked by learners.
This has resulted in the reduction of cases of children dropping out of school because of walking long distances. Clinics have also been built in areas were communities were struggling to access health care services. In a statement, the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works’ communications and advocacy director, Mr Gabriel Masvora said last year Government disbursed $1,3 billion devolution funds to the province. In 2021 the province received $219 million; then $25 million in 2020 and $25 million in 2019. By December last year Government had disbursed $1,6 billion to the province. Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister, Cde Abedinico Ncube said devolution funds are a fruit of the devolution programme which seeks to ensure that communities develop their areas. “Government is spearheading the devolution agenda and with it comes the devolution fund. This fund has played a crucial role in ensuring that significant development is recorded in all districts of the province. Schools and clinics have been built and many more are under construction. Infrastructure has been rehabilitated, roads are being maintained, bridges are being constructed. Even council staff has been capacitated with vehicles and equipment such as laptops. We thank Government that local authorities in the province have significantly benefited from the devolution fund. Indeed, Matabeleland South hasn’t been left behind,” he said. In Mangwe District, devolution funds have helped in constructing Izimnyama Clinic which had remained a pipe dream for 70 years. The project was mooted in 1953 but never took off. Efforts to resume the project in the 1980s did not bear fruit until the coming in of the Second Republic. <img class="size-large wp-image-614490" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-48-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Abedinico Ncube Devolution funds have also helped to assist in building two primary schools in the district in areas that have been recording high cases of school drop outs because of long distances.
