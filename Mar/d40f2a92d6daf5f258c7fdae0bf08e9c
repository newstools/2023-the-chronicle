The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN forward Knox Mutizwa continued with his goal-scoring streak for Lamontville Golden Arrows in South Africa, this time netting in the Nedbank Cup round of 16, albeit in a losing cause. Golden Arrows crashed out of Mzansi’s most lucrative club knockout competition, the Nedbank Cup after suffering a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Royal AM at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday. Mutizwa scored a 95th minute equaliser to send the match into extra time after Brazilian Ricardo Nascimento had opened the scoring for Royal AM with a 33rd minute penalty. Arrows crumbled in extra time, which saw them concede two goals and Royal AM proceeded to the quarter-finals of the cup competition. Mutizwa has been in prolific form lately. Just last week, the Zimbabwean forward joined a list of top footballers who scored 50 league goals for one club in Mzansi’s topflight.  He is the 10th player in PSL top-flight history to score 50 league goals for a single club. Daniel Mudau, Wilfred Mugeyi, Tico-Tico Bucuane, Gilbert Mushangazhike, Bradley Grobler, Surprise Moriri, Siyabonga Nomvethe, Jean-Marc and Themba Zwane are the other players to score 50 league goals for one team in South Africa’s PSL. The Zimbabwean striker has managed to find his form since the turn of the year with six Premier Soccer League goals in the eight matches that Golden Arrows have played in 2023. He has also scored two goals in cup games, bringing his tally to 8. The sharpshooter joined Golden Arrows in 2017 from Bidvest Wits after struggling for game time at Wits only featuring in the reserve team in the Multichoice Diski Challenge. Mutizwa was not the only Zimbabwean to find the back of the net in South Africa as Ronald Pfumbidzai scored in Chippa United’s 2-0 win over Mpheni Home Defenders. It was Pfumbidzai’s fourth goal in all competitions this season. — @innocentskizoe
