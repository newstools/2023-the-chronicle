Without the required accreditation, one cannot take charge of any match. “For one to serve as an umpire or lines judge or referee in badminton, they must be accredited with this course. Note, all badminton association courses have certificates after completion,” said BDA president, Tatenda Mamina. The training course also comes at the right moment as the province is set to host an inaugural tournament in the Southern region of the country and attendees at the workshop will get the chance to officiate in the championship. They will take charge of matches alongside national officials. <img class="wp-image-685516 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Badminton Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are singles and doubles. It is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach, however, formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side’s half of the court. – @brandon_malvin
