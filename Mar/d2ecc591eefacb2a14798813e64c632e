The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders Football Club striker Rodi Sibanda scored his first goal in the Botswana Premier Soccer League when his Sua Flamingoes club lost 2-1 to the Mandla “Lulu” Mpofu coached Masitaoka at Molepolole Sports Complex on Saturday. It was Sibanda’s fourth game for Sua Flamingoes after he joined the team during the January transfer window. <img class="wp-image-686673 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-58.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-58.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-58-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rodi Sibanda in action for Sua Flamingoes The ex-Orlando Pirates youth product and Bulawayo City striker gave Sua Flamingoes a 24th minute lead before his side fell to Masitaoka who remained stuck on position five with 31 points after 18 games. Disappointed that his team failed to win, Sibanda is hopeful of scoring more goals. “I’m happy that I’ve broken the duck but at the same time disappointed that we failed to at least take a point back home. We played well, dominated the game but still failed to defend our lead and go back to Sowa Town with at least a point. “I’ll keep on working hard so that I repay the coaches’ faith in me as well as lift my game,” said Sibanda. For Mpofu’s side, the victory was sweet as they bounced back to winning ways following a midweek 3-2 defeat to Eleven Angels. The ex-Highlanders gaffer was full of praise for his charges. “The lads deserve a pat on the back for recovering from that heartbreaking defeat to Eleven Angels. I’m equally happy with the victory and we will keep pushing so that we improve with every outing,” said Mpofu. Meanwhile, leaders Jwaneng Galaxy maintained their five point gap when they beat Prison XI 2-0 at the Galaxy Stadium.  Nqobizitha Masuku started the match and went out in the 49th minute, the moment winger Daniel Msendami was introduced as the championship favourites cruised to victory. On the same day, second placed defending champions Gaborone United suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Eleven Angels at the Francistown Stadium, their second consecutive defeat. While Mpofu celebrated picking up the three points, Taurai Mangwiro’s nine-game unbeaten streak came to a halt when his Orapa United lost 2-1 to former champions Township Rollers. Orapa United, third on the table now trail leaders Jwaneng Galaxy by eight points. – @ZililoR
