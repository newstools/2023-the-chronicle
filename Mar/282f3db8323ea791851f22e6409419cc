IMBIZO District yesterday took control on the first day of the Bulawayo Metropolitan inter-district National Association of Secondary Heads track and field championships before the final session that had four medley relay races on the cards at White City Stadium. Five districts, Mzilikazi, Bulawayo Central, Imbizo, Khami and Reigate are battling it out in the event that was last held three years ago owing to a halt in sporting activities caused by Covid-19. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-685778" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Athletics-action-at-White-City-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Athletics-action-at-White-City.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Athletics-action-at-White-City-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> From the meet, athletes to represent the province at the national finals will be selected. The national finals will take place at Peterhouse College in Marondera from March 22-23. From the nationals, a team will be selected to take part at the Confederation of School Sport Associations of Southern Africa Games later in the year. Heading into the last session of day one, Imbizo had accumulated 12 gold medals, four silver and seven bronze medals making a total of 23 medals. Most of the medals accrued by Imbizo were from field events whose finals were held on day one.  Mzilikazi District, with the highest number of medals with 29 had managed nine gold, 13 silver, and seven bronze.
Given the way they conquered in the track events, it will not be a surprise if Mzilikazi is top of the table by the end of day two today. Reigate were in third place with eight gold, five silver, and eight bronze medals. In fourth place were Khami with four gold, seven silver and 10 bronze medals. Bulawayo Central could only manage two gold, five silver and three bronze medals. Bulawayo Nash Head in Charge of athletics Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu said they were excited to have athletics back in schools. “We are glad that finally, we are back on the track. It’s one sport that has been missing that helps us maintain discipline in schools. We believe we are back with a bang. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-685777" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Action-from-White-City-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Action-from-White-City.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Action-from-White-City-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “There is an element of rustiness from the athletes but we cannot blame that on anyone because of the long break we had for over three years but we commend the work that the coaches played. “We have seen good talent from both the track and field events. The competition has been good. We are expecting to pick up athletes who will make podium finishes at the nationals. “It’s a big task for the coaches to trim the numbers and get the best athletes that will bring medals for Bulawayo,” said Ndlovu. — @innocentskizoe
