Gogo Sibanda says she believes in hard work and this is the reason why she is still in business producing handbags. She said she started making handbags with beadwork decorations in 2019 and her advantage is that her sight is still sharp.
Gogo Sibanda said before the handbags, she used to crochet doilies, knit jerseys and various items using wool she got from old clothes. “I have always been doing handwork. Back then, I used to do very beautiful crochet work in the form of doilies, blankets, jerseys and other various items. I did all this in my youth days and people used to buy a lot from me,” she said.  Gogo Sibanda said she started producing handbags as a church project as they meet as women every Thursday to work on various projects meant to empower them. She said producing handbags does not only keep her busy but is also a source of income.
Gogo Sibanda said the church project has provided a space where elderly women like herself get the opportunity to mingle with the young women and advise them on ways to empower themselves. <img class="size-large wp-image-688057" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tterwqw2a3s-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tterwqw2a3s.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tterwqw2a3s-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gogo Gladys Sibanda “I buy most of the raw materials in town and business has been fair. However, nowadays my business is low but I continue making the bags because once you get used to doing something you can’t stop,” she said. Gogo Sibanda who said her long-term plan was to engage marketing people to find a bigger market for her products, says she sells her bags for US$25 and US$40.– @ReeSibanda
