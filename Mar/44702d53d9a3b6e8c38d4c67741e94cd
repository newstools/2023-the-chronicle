HISTORY is set to be made as the Zimbabwe Baseball Association (ZBA) sends their first-ever senior women’s team for the South Africa National Baseball Championships next month. ZBA has been working on establishing a women’s national team since last year. The association’s vice-president, Eldon Mudzingwa says they are excited to see their project take shape. “We have begun baseball for ladies. We started the process last year. We had a provincial tournament in Harare in August and we did another one in Bulawayo in December.  “We used the two tournaments to come up with a Zimbabwe select side which will become the Zimbabwe senior national team. “This is the first-ever ladies baseball team to be set in the country,” said Mudzingwa. “We have not been participating in ladies baseball but that is all going to change as our ladies side are headed for South Africa for a tournament during the Easter Holidays,” Mudzingwa said. The South Africa Baseball Championships will be held at the Cardinals Baseball Club, Boksburg, Gauteng from April 7 to 11. <img class="alignnone wp-image-478341 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/BASEBALL1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/BASEBALL1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/BASEBALL1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe was mainly dedicated to softball for a decade after independence, but in 1990 Malcom Burne introduced baseball in the country, as president of the association. In 2007, Zimbabwe’s baseball and softball bodies split and the country participated in the All-Africa Games in 1999, 2003 and 2007 where they won bronze medals in all three editions. In 2019, Zimbabwe men participated in the Africa Baseball Championship and again won bronze. — @innocentskizoe
