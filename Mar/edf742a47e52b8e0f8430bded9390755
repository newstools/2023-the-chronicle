PRINCE Edward High School in Harare will play host to a schools rugby festival from April 24 to 29. The festival comes as the school is celebrating 125 years of existence and has invited various schools from around the country to take part. Schools rugby festivals are meant to widen the player pool in the country through promoting the sport at junior level. The festival will also serve as an educational platform for the up-and-coming rugby stars. Prince Edward has over the years hosted the Cottco Rugby Festival, which later became the Dairibord Rugby Festival which used to take place a week before the opening of schools.  “The Zimbabwe Schools Rugby Festival envisioned rugby as the most suitable vehicle to improve the health and education of school pupils and to promote the playing of the game at this level (schools) thereby creating a wider player base for ultimate participation at senior and national level,” read part of the tournament invitation. Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB) hosts a two-day rugby fiesta at the city’s ceremonial home of rugby, Hartsfield Rugby Grounds, from March 31 to April 1 and some of the players at this festival are likely to participate at the Prince Edward High School festival. <img class="wp-image-631084 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-10.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-10.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-21-10-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hartsfield Rugby Grounds Sponsored by Pony Club Investments, the Bulawayo festival will be the first in 2023 and is expected to attract teams from around the country and across the borders.
