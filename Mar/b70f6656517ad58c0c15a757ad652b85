The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau The construction of a third bridge across the Limpopo at Beitbridge between Zimbabwe and South Africa has been approved by Cabinet, as the Government moves a gear up to ensure required infrastructure is always in place for the rapidly growing regional and international trade in line with its ease of doing business policy. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona said technocrats were already hard at work, setting the necessary legal frameworks and the contractor was completing the feasibility studies while the basic political permissions were being given. In an interview soon after handing over 220 housing units for civil servants and border agencies to the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works in Beitbridge, Minister Mhona said they intend to have the new proposed bridge to run parallel to the New Limpopo Bridge.  The original Alfred Beit Bridge paid for by the Beit Trust was opened in 1929 replacing the old Leibigs Drift as the direct road link between Zimbabwe and South Africa. Traffic gradually grew and in the mid-1970s the railway went over the same bridge when the new Rutenga-Beitbridge link was built. By the mid-1990s the old bridge was hardly coping and in 1995 the second bridge, the New Limpopo Bridge, a pure road bridge, was opened. This allowed the old Alfred Beit Bridge to be dedicated to rail and pedestrian traffic, with the growing flood of pedestrians grateful for the dramatic increase in safety. Minister Mhona said the Government has so far completed the upgrading of Beitbridge Border Post at a cost of US$300 million through a public-private partnership arrangement, which now allows it to handle the growing traffic for some time with minimal border delays. <img class="wp-image-652620 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/The-Beitbridge-Border-Post.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/The-Beitbridge-Border-Post.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/The-Beitbridge-Border-Post-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Beitbridge Border Post The new border post has three terminals namely freight, bus and light vehicles, which have improved the flow of traffic through automation. In addition, a new fire station, sewer oxidation dam, an animal plant and quarantine centre, a 11,4 mega litres water reservoir and 220 housing units which fall under the out of port works scope. The border post handles 15 000 travellers, 1 200 commercial trucks, 1 500 light vehicles, and 120 buses daily. <img class="wp-image-650890 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/hyjeudfhfbcfb.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/hyjeudfhfbcfb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/hyjeudfhfbcfb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge Border Post is one of the development initiatives undertaken by the Second Republic “Initially when we were undertaking this project, we were supposed to have constructed the second bridge, but because of bilateral arrangements we decided to separate it from the current border work,” said Minister Mhona. “We are happy to note President Mnangagwa is already engaging his South African counterpart (President Ramaphosa) over the issues. “Cabinet has already sanctioned this project and recently the project was approved and the contractor is doing feasibility studies which are almost done.” The contractor is expected to move on site as soon as engagements with South Africa were complete. The idea of having a second road bridge is meant to promote regional and international trade by having a seamless flow of commercial cargo through the Beitbridge Border Post.
