The Chronicle John 11 Remember Mary who anointed Jesus’ feet with expensive fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, (John 12 v 1-8)? She was Lazarus’ sister. Yes, Lazarus who was raised from the dead, whom the Bible describes as Jesus’ beloved friend. We all know the story; Mary sends for Jesus when Lazarus gets sick, he dies and Jesus then comes four days after he was buried. These are people accounted to be loved by Jesus so much so that when He got to the tomb, He wept. Took His sweet time, didn’t He? Which begs the question that could have crossed your mind as you’ve been reading, or at some point in your meditation of the Word; “How can someone whom Jesus loves fall sick?” <img class="wp-image-570964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Remember Mary who anointed Jesus’ feet with expensive fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, (John 12 v 1-8)? She was Lazarus’ sister. God allowed Lazarus to be sick, even though He loved him. Him crying at his grave tells us that it wasn’t easy for Him to see His beloved dead, even so knowing he was sick. But at the end of it all, God received the glory. We survived a deadly season of Covid-19 across the globe. Similarly, God allowed Lazarus to be sick and even die. Yes, some of our loved ones died. One area or another in our lives died, maybe your career, academics, business, relations, maybe you even lost it there for a moment but today, take with you the truth that even in your worst situations, four days after burial, God’s glory shall be seen from that. God will shine through you. Hang tight.  As a believer Jesus loves you, fact, but we need to address that that doesn’t mean it is going to be good things all the time. There will come a time that resembles a kind of sickness, or a death in your life. The reason for the negativity in your life is that God loves you and God wants to glorify Himself through that situation. It is not a permanent uncontrollable situation. Jesus allowed Lazarus’ sickness within His jurisdiction and power BUT the sickness was not unto death. That negative situation is not permanent. God is going to be glorified through that. Trust His ways (Isaiah 55 v 8), have faith, and believe. God is taking you through a valley (Psalm 23 v 4). You wait and see how He will turn that situation.
