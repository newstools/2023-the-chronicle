The Chronicle What made God remember the Children of Israel was the covenants that He made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God is not just moved by prayer or groanings. If you do not have a covenant trigger, you may cry and cry but you might not see a quick response from God in your life or in anything that you are doing. God is moved by covenants. A Covenant is a binding agreement that is irreversible and irrevocable between three people who become the three representatives of the agreement <img class="wp-image-570964 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/bible-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> There are 10 things that would be done whenever a binding covenant was established.
Exchange of Robes – This represented royalty and covering. Whenever there was going to be a Covenant agreement, there would be one who is greater, one lesser and the greatest one. Exchange of Weapons – These are tools and that is why the Bible says we have weapons that are mighty in Christ
Exchange of Blood – They would cut their palm and mix their blood in a cup, then they would drink it. This is why Jesus says you cannot come into my Father’s House without drinking my Blood. We drink the Blood of Jesus through Holy Communion; it may be red juice in the physical but in the Spirit, it is the Blood of Jesus  Walking in the Blood – In Genesis 15, God instructed Abraham to cut the sacrifice in half and then God and Abraham walked through the blood. God came in the form of a torch and met Abraham in the middle. That is why we must walk through the Blood of Jesus, we must speak the Blood of Jesus upon us and we must drink the Blood of Jesus. Exchange of Names – You have to give up your rights and take up the identity of the one who is more powerful than you. That is why wives take the name of their husband, it is spiritual. Demons run away from you because they see a greater name on you. As a Child of God, you are surnamed “Jesus Christ”. That is why the Bible says we are called after the Name that is above all names. In the Spiritual you get another name and becomes your covering, as you are Covenanted with Christ.
