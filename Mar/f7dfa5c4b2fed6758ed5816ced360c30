A 69-YEAR-OLD man, Richard Siyeleba Mnkandla (pictured) from Nketa 6 suburb has been missing for more than 24 hours and his relatives are appealing for information that may assist in finding him. Mnkandla was last seen on Monday around 3PM in the suburb wearing a blue and white striped t-shirt, a black leather jacket and a track bottom. His son, Mr Thabani Mnkandla (33) said his father is unwell and has not taken any of his medication since he went missing.
Mr Mnkandla said his missing father suffers from dementia, diabetes and is hypertensive.  “My father lives with my mother and my two sisters. He would often get out of the house to get some fresh air and did the same on Monday but never came back. My mother realised that he was nowhere to be found at around 3PM that same day,” said Mr Mnkandla. He said his mother told him that his father had not returned home around 5PM and this was when they started searching for him to no avail. <img class="size-large wp-image-685309" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/mhbbb-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/mhbbb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/mhbbb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  MR RICHARD SIYELEBA MNKANDLA Mr Mnkandla said he made a report at Tshabalala police station yesterday and they have since started distributing posters to members of the public to help locate their father. “A lady who sells her wares close to our house and other people in the suburb said they saw him walking towards the bus stop. I’m very worried because no one out there knows of the conditions he suffers from and how fragile he is,” he said. Mr Mnkandla said the last time he saw his father, he kept insisting that he wanted to go back to his rural home where he stays most of the time. He added that his father came to Bulawayo on Sunday to buy groceries and other essentials needed at their rural home.
