The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders juniors striker Daniel Msendami, absent from Jwaneng Galaxy’s last weekend game due to suspension, will be available for selection when his Botswana Premier Soccer League side take on relegation threatened Prison XI on Saturday. Msendami (22), who has been dazzling the Botswana Premiership with sublime displays watched from the terraces as Jwaneng Galaxy opened a five-point lead at the top of the table following a 3-1 win against Security Systems.
On his debut season in the Botswana Premier League, Msendami has scored five goals in the 13 matches he has played, providing six assists for the championship favourites Jwaneng Galaxy, the only team yet to lose a game in 17 outings.  Jwaneng Galaxy are on 43 points and Msendami is aware that reclaiming his starting jersey will not be easy.
“The team played well and to be honest, you don’t want to miss a game because it becomes difficult to get back into the team especially after a victory. At this stage of the season the coach is emphasising on the need to take each game as it comes and not dwell on the championship and it is for this reason that I’m training hard to be available for selection. “I know we will be playing a team that is second from the bottom of the table, but that doesn’t change the attitude we have as a team and the ultimate goal we are fighting for. Right now I think we’re in control of our destiny and have to do the job ourselves,” said Msendami. <img class="wp-image-639080 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-34-9.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-34-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-34-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nqobizitha Masuku The winger who shares lodgings with former Highlanders’ central midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku is reportedly being followed by a number of South African clubs as well as teams in Tanzania and Qatar.
