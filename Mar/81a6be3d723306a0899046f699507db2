The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League returnees Hwange say they are done with their player recruitment ahead of the start of the 2023 action on March 18. The first transfer window is scheduled to close on March 31 and the coal miners administrator Khumbulani Mbano revealed that their squad was now ready to do duty in the country’s elite football league. <img class="wp-image-685388 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/csdas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/csdas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/csdas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tendai Muvuti in Bulawayo Chiefs colours “With the transfer window set to close on 31 March, I can confirm that we are done with regards to our player recruitment exercise. We now have a full squad of 25 senior players and five junior players. We are now ready to compete,” said Mbano. He said although they will be without the services of their former captain Felix “SaNicky” Chindungwe, who has since retired to assume the role of kit manager at the club, they are happy that they still have gritty midfielder Thabani Goredema, pacy and skillful winger Cannan Nkomo and impressive striker Ernest Gwitima.  The club also signed Copa Coca-Cola product Tendai ‘’Shumba” Muvuti, a 19-year-old former Mpopoma High School pupil who shined at the schools football competition in 2019.
Last year, Muvuti, who has already featured in Chipangano’s pre-season friendly matches, was in the books of Bulawayo Chiefs where he was not given game time. The young attacking midfielder joined Chipangano as one of the junior players together with the club’s junior team graduates Attitude Munsaka, Quinton Longwei and Proud Anesu Richard. The club also roped in Claivert Tshuma who previously turned out for Dynamos. – @FungaiMuderere.
