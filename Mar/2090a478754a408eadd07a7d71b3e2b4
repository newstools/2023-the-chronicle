The 131-hectare irrigation scheme in the Sanzukwi area, was established in 2004. It operated partially for four years before it collapsed. It has a capacity to accommodate over 100 households. Government under the Second Republic is rehabilitating and reviving irrigation schemes that have been lying idle in the province as part of its accelerated rural industrialisation drive. It has also established new irrigation schemes that have been on paper for years. <img class="size-large wp-image-687094" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Pipe-laying-and-trench-digging-works-at-Bambanani-irrigation-scheme-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Pipe-laying-and-trench-digging-works-at-Bambanani-irrigation-scheme.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Pipe-laying-and-trench-digging-works-at-Bambanani-irrigation-scheme-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pipe laying and trench digging works at Bambanani irrigation scheme Among the new schemes is the 200-hectare Mtshabezi Irrigation Scheme in Gwanda which was established last year. The irrigation scheme had been on paper for 87 years. Other irrigation schemes that have been rehabilitated include Makwe, Guyu- Chelesa, Sebasa, Silalatshani and Tshikwalakwala.
A villager from Sanzukwi area, Mr Phumuza Mangena said the start of rehabilitation works at Bambanani irrigation scheme had brought relief to the community. He said they had been waiting for a long time for works to start.
“Works to rehabilitate our irrigation scheme are ongoing and this has brought relief to us a community. We tried several times to rehabilitate the irrigation scheme and even tried to engage various stakeholders to assist us but all efforts didn’t materialise,” said Mr Mangena. He said they were looking forward to having their first crop by the end of the year.
“This irrigation scheme will help us to fend for our families. We will not only grow produce for ourselves but also for our animals. Rain fed agriculture has been holding us back as we want to produce throughout the year,” said Mr Mangena.  Another villager, Ms Cynthia Dube said the project will create employment for locals, especially the youths. She said as a community they were eager to come in and assist during the rehabilitation. Ms Dube said if the works are completed on time, they will plant winter wheat.
Chief Sangulube said rehabilitation of Bambanani Irrigation Scheme was a positive development that will benefit his community. He said the irrigation scheme was once the bread basket of the community.
“This irrigation scheme was a major source of livelihood for my people as many families depended on it. When it collapses due to water challenges, many families were left stranded, said Chief Sangulube. He said he was happy with the progress so far and was confident the company will meet its target of completing the work by June. “The intervention by Government is most welcome as this scheme used to benefit families from Ward 5 and 6,” said Chief Sangulube. <img class="size-large wp-image-674430" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bhkmb-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bhkmb.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/bhkmb-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bambanani irrigation scheme in Mangwe Matabeleland South acting provincial irrigation engineer, Mr Mr Sheperd Mpotegwa said the rehabilitation works include installing an electric motor at the pump station, laying water pipes, installing a centre pivot and a drip system.
