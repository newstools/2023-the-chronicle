The roadmap sets out pragmatic plans to bring in structural transformation and move up the value chains. Under this strategy, Zimbabwe has come up with 10 priority value chains for the period 2021-2025, which include cotton to clothing, sugar, soya, dairy, leather, fertiliser, bus and truck, iron and steel, waste plastic, and pharmaceutical value chains. United Nations Economic Commission for Africa sub-regional office representative for Southern Africa, Mr Oliver Maponga, who also attended the meeting stressed the need to focus on inclusive industrialisation.  “We are committed to supporting industrialisation, which leaves no place and no gender behind, allowing stakeholders to move together in an industrialised environment where the country is able to produce products that will facilitate the exploitation of the market created by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement,” he said. The UNECA sub-regional office supports the industrialisation agenda in Zimbabwe and in other Southern African regional member states.
