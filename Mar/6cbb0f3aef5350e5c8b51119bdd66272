The Chronicle Ranga Mataire, Group Political Editor In yet another example of serious lack of introspection, depth and political maturity, CCC leader, Mr Nelson Chamisa, referred to the people of Zimbabwe as baboons as he gathered journalists to brief them about a document he called PREPARE. As predicted, no one remembers what that document was all about but they surely are still stuck with the “monkeys and baboons” slur that he mentioned as referred to at the end of his address. In a serious show of myopia, Mr Chamisa said his political strategies remain secret, arguing that he wants to do things differently than those expected by his opponents. <img class="size-large wp-image-625177" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-73-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Ordinarily, no one should have qualms with his “secret strategy” because that’s his own business and those who follow him but calling the electorate baboons was out of tune with the decency expected of an aspiring national leader. As he concluded his presser, Mr Chamisa said: “In Zimbabwe, we are worse off than baboons and monkeys. The way we fight over politics, you will never see such a fight when you go to the bush. Donkeys don’t even fight that way: so primitive.” But this was not the first time that the young politician has said something so obnoxious as to disturb the sensibilities of normal political engagement. In 2018, Mr Chamisa shocked the world when he called his own supporters stupid. This was after they had protested against the yet to be announced election results. Many were left uneasy with Mr Chamisa’s utterances and said that statement, among other gaffes, could have precipitated the eventual split of the MDC Alliance.  “You are talking about an election that has not been declared. And why would I even react because I do not know the results that will be announced?” “It was very stupid, even for people who demonstrated . . . it was stupid, because they then opened themselves for attacks and manipulation,” he told journalists. “I think whoever demonstrated – it was their right, but I feel it was not called for,” Mr Chamisa said as he addressed journalists. We all know the origins of stereotyping blacks to monkeys or baboons. We also are aware of the stereotyping of blacks as perpetual children and buffoons. From Locke, Charles Darwin to Joseph Conrad’s The Heart of Darkness, European literature and historical narratives including anthropology is replete with these racist tropes. But no one least expected a young black politician aspiring to lead an African nation to use the same tropes. Something is fundamentally wrong here. It’s either the man is genuinely ignorant of such tropes or the sensitivity in insulting your fellow compatriots in such a manner or it reflects at a subconscious level the people he spends most of his time with. Either way, it is unacceptable and insensitive for Mr Chamisa to use the same negative stereotypes that have been at the centre of the dehumanisation of Africa from slavery to colonialism and now in the post-colonial epoch. <img class="size-large wp-image-508034" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Baboons-Gwanda-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Baboons-Gwanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Baboons-Gwanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Conscientious Africans will find Mr Chamisa’s slur highly objectionable and inappropriate especially for one aspiring for the highest office in the land.
