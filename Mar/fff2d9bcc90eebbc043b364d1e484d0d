The Chronicle Rejoyce Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter Fundile Nkala is a 26-year-old teacher, counsellor and mental health advocate who is driven by her inner mandate to always do great things for people and communities, even when no one was watching. She is a respected teacher at Sigola Primary School on the outskirts of Bulawayo in Matabeleland South Province. In her work as a teacher, Fundile noticed various challenges that some school children faced in their everyday dealings. She was particularly concerned about the issue of children walking barefooted to school, which made them vulnerable to bullying and societal ills. <img class="wp-image-688813 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yyuuytfr.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yyuuytfr.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/yyuuytfr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fundile Nkala – Global Intergrity Icon Award Winner To address this issue, Fundile has established a shoe drive initiative that aims to donate school shoes to pupils at Sukasihambe Primary School and other nearby communities. The initiative also focuses on donating school materials such as stationery, uniforms, and clothes. “I realised that most learners were walking long distances barefooted despite unfavourable weather conditions. I noted that learners lacking such essential materials make them vulnerable to bullying and societal ills,” said Fundile. But Fundile has not stopped there. She is now an advocate for equality, inclusive of education for the marginalised. She realised that there was a gap between rural and urban education, which was possibly one of the reasons behind the low pass rate in rural areas.  “I was already taking up the advocacy route but upon realising such a fact, I was then strongly moved and found the need to do something about the educational system,” she said. In all her philanthropic works, Fundile’s goal is to bridge the societal gaps and natural intelligences. She also advocates for mental health, having studied that most people suffered from mental-related issues. However, because society has not yet demystified it, mental health remains detrimental to communities. She wants to change this and educate people on how to handle these issues differently. Through her mental health workshops with Generation Empowerment Trust, a non-governmental organisation, Fundile has had conversations with men on mental health. Her goal is to help people manage mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar, mania, and schizophrenia, which could be managed with the right medication and therapy. “After attaining my diploma in education, I spent some time at home. Most people after graduation expect stability, and employment but that is not always the case in Zimbabwe. Hence most people have suffered depression because of so many issues other than poverty, and societal expectations. Bulawayo always has a rising number of suicides among young people hence I feel if we educate people, they may handle these issues differently,” said Fundile Fundile’s philanthropic works has not gone unnoticed. In 2022, she won the Accountability Lab Integrity Icon Award, which was to honour all the outstanding deeds that she had been doing outside teaching. The global Integrity Icon Award celebrates honest government officials and role models individuals who go beyond the call of duty to realise a collective societal shift towards ethical conduct and greater accountability. “The world would be a better place if we showed a little bit of kindness because the world is already cruel enough and people are going through a lot. What we do, and what we say can either make or break a person. Small actions are seen and they do make a difference,” said Fundile. Fundile’s aspirations do not end there. She is also an aspiring broiler farmer who wants to grow her farming trade to create employment for people around her community. Her dedication to helping people and communities is making a significant impact and sets her apart as a true hero.– @ReeSibanda
