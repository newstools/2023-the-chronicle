The Chronicle Parliament of Zimbabwe should take heed of the call by Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Maxwell Takuva for tough laws stipulating mandatory lengthy sentences for drug dealers. Justice Takuva, who made the call as he officially opened the Hwange High Court circuit on Monday, said due to the lack of specification of some drugs as dangerous substances, police and prosecutors are finding it difficult to have drug dealers convicted. Of concern, the Hwange High Court circuit will hear 22 murder cases, five of which are drug-related and committed by mentally challenged persons.  The call also comes just over a month after 17 youths from Entumbane suburb in Bulawayo were rushed to Ingutsheni Central Hospital for overdosing on crystal methamphetamine (meth). About 250 drug addicts are admitted to Ingutsheni Central Hospital monthly. Last month, police launched a war against drug lords and drug abuse, but vague drug laws have made police and prosecutors fail to come up with appropriate charges. In Hwange, a drug dealer, Lewis Paruzere, was found with three sachets of crystal meth weighing 5 grammes, but was found not guilty and acquitted by a magistrate on technicalities associated with the lack of a proper law. As we reported yesterday, Justice Takuva said there is a need for a properly structured multifaceted approach. “It is true that the laws on drugs are vague resulting in police and prosecutors experiencing difficulties in coming up with appropriate charges. This will have a bearing on the penalty that is ultimately imposed on the culprit,” said Justice Takuva. “It is, therefore, the duty of everyone to fight this menace in the country. The police alone cannot prevent or fight this menace. There is a need for legislators, chiefs, religious authorities, communities, councillors and other elected officials to join the anti-drug fight so that the message reaches as many people as possible. Crafting new appropriate laws is one way which should be considered to help to deal with rampant abuse of drugs and alcohol.” <img class="wp-image-652856 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/ingutsheni.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/ingutsheni.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/ingutsheni-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ingutsheni Hospital We agree with Justice Takuva. Parliament must grab the bull by the horns and tighten drug laws. The law must be deterrent enough to dissuade drug dealers from poisoning our youth and fanning crime. Get rid of the drug dealers and the problem will go away. Drug dealers, especially those selling drugs to teenagers, do not belong to our society. They should be deported to God-knows-where. To think that some of us love money so much that we will sell drugs to children. How do we sleep at night? Parliament must not sleep on the job. The youth are dying every day, and those who survive death lose their minds, talent and opportunities. Let the law protect the poor, the vulnerable, and the children. The innocent children who are the leaders of tomorrow.
