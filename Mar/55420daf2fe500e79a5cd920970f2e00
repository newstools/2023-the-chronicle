Jessica and Tongayi are coming from an industry that functional-so what better way to bring their skill to tell stories at a high standard while imparting knowledge to the local sector.” Chirisa is also excited about the project. “When I read the script I knew I had to be part of it because of the story telling where it’s located and the message of hope, survival and forgiveness,” he said.
