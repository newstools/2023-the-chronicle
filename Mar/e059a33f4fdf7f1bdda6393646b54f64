WHEN villagers in Mpumelelo Village 25 in Kachechete Ward started Vusanani Irrigation Scheme in 2014, their goal was to ensure food security for the whole community. Since then however, the community has not been able to get irrigation equipment to water the land during the dry season. Despite this, the project has sustained many families as the 59 members can pay school fees for their children, cater for their daily needs and provide food even during droughts. <img class="size-large wp-image-685246" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/seesedfdf-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/seesedfdf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/seesedfdf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Members of Vusanani Irrigation project in Ndlovu outside Victoria Falls Government last year launched the Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy, which envisions a Zimbabwe that is food secure. The strategy also seeks to eliminate food imports, deepen exports, create up to 1 million jobs by 2025 and build a Zimbabwe powered by agriculture. This is in line with the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1) towards attaining Vision 2030.
Government aims to establish irrigation schemes in every district across the country to ensure food security and rural development. Located about 45km from Victoria Falls, the 1 500-hectare project has potential to sustain more livelihoods and multiply dividends if it is supported by an irrigation system. <img class="size-large wp-image-624166" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-20-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) Members grow a variety of grain crops, groundnuts and sunflower, which are rain fed. They are drawn from BH10, BH25 and BH38, which are all under Mpumelelo and comprise the elderly and youths. Each member has a 28 by 150 metre plot where they grow different kinds of crops. On average, each farmer harvests about two tonnes of grain and hopes are high that production could increase under irrigation.
The project members are appealing for help to drill a borehole and install an irrigation system to intensify production. They have so far approached donors such as Caritas and Amalima Loko who have promised to look into the proposal.
A well-wisher once sunk a borehole that was powered by a windmill near the piece of land but later took away the equipment after some disagreements with the community.  The site of the project was once a paddock and the donor had wanted no change of use while the community opted to convert it to an irrigation scheme for food security. A Chronicle news crew visited the irrigation scheme recently and noted thriving maize, sorghum, millet, sunflower and groundnuts crops. Some of the project members use Intwasa Conservation farming with help from Agritex officers and get some of the inputs from the Government. BH25B Village Head Mrs Gladys Maphosa said the project is a source of livelihood as members are able to pay school fees, buy food, clothes and other necessities for their families. “We started in 2014 when our fields had become infertile, causing droughts every season while families had grown big. This was a paddock for our livestock and the community resolved that we convert it into a community garden so that we grow crops all year round. <img class="size-large wp-image-685248" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/rfrtyyyhyh7uuhj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/rfrtyyyhyh7uuhj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/rfrtyyyhyh7uuhj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “After taking the issue to the village assembly, ward, District Development Coordinator and local authority offices, we then started clearing. Each member was allocated a plot where we grow crops during the rainy season.
