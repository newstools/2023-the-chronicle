The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SPRINTER Amanda Msongelwa left National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) Bulawayo Metropolitan school heads green with envy after claiming two gold medals at the provincial inter-district competitions that ended at White City Stadium on Friday. Msongelwa won the 200m and 100m finals. Sadly for the province, Msongelwa who is a learner at Girls College only participated in the competition as a guest as her school is not an affiliate of Nash. She ran under Imbizo district in the inter-district competition and impressed not only the crowd but the school heads in attendance. Provincial head in charge of athletics, Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu said: “We will have to look at the rules and regulations but her talent is undoubted. She could definitely pick us some medals in Marondera but her situation is complicated.” Last year, Msongelwa broke the 200m record in her age group during the Southern African Christian Schools’ Sports Association (Sacssa) meet which was held in Sasolburg, South Africa. <img class="wp-image-686677 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-61.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-61.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-61-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Amanda Msongelwa in white and black In her victory in the 200m race, Msongelwa broke the standing record as she finished her race in 26, 77 seconds to bag gold and she was followed by her compatriot, Ruvimbo Sibanda who finished in 28, 40 seconds.
