The Chronicle Michael Makuza, Business Reporter GOVERNMENT has appointed a 20-member technical committee to be part of the team responsible for the implementation of power projects in the country. This comes after Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, announced Government’s willingness last December to speed up investments by independent power producers (IPPs) in the energy sector with a special focus on solar projects. Since then, the Ministry of Energy and Power Development has been convening meetings with the relevant stakeholders to discuss the selection criteria of the qualifying IPPs, the composition of the technical committee, and the terms of reference of the committee. “The technical committee shall consist of representatives from the Ministry of Energy and Power Development (MoEPD), the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED), Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC), Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA), The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and any other person(s) nominated or recommended by any of the two permanent secretaries,” said the ministry in a statement. <img class="wp-image-634999 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-50-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) The committee members include Engineer B Munyaradzi (chief director at MoEPD), Dr S Ziuku (director MoEPD), Mr M Manyundo (MoEPD), Ms S Kavu (MoEPD), Mr F Tinarwo (MoEPD), Mr P Mupiwa (MoEPD), Ms T Gwebu (MoEPD), Mr I Munaki (MoEPD), Mr T Karise (MoEPD), Mr W Zimbiti (MoEPD), Mr K Makacha (MoEPD), Mr M Ndovorwi (ZERA), Mr Madondo (ZERA), Mr L Nechitoro (ZERA), Mrs G Ngoma (ZERA), Eng I Dube (ZETDC), Eng J Diya (ZETDC), Mr K Tapfuma (ZETDC), Eng N A Kajengo (ZETDC) and an RBZ representative. <img class="alignnone wp-image-607228 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/The-Zimbabwe-Energy-Regulatory-Authority-Zera.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/The-Zimbabwe-Energy-Regulatory-Authority-Zera.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/The-Zimbabwe-Energy-Regulatory-Authority-Zera-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Ministry of Energy and Power Development said the selection criteria for the projects to be considered for the Government Guarantee shall be those under construction, projects about to reach financial closure, and projects yet to commence construction.
