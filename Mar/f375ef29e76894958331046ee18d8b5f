EDUCATION authorities are considering transforming single-sex Government schools in Bulawayo into mixed ones as part of measures to address gang-related violence in learning institutions. Bulawayo is dealing with age long school-related turf wars pitting several schools in the city. The problem reached a crescendo last month when a Form Four Founders High School pupil, Wayne Ndlovu (16), was stabbed to death by a learner from Hamilton High School. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-685258" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/guyguyj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/guyguyj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/guyguyj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The 17-year-old Hamilton High School pupil was locked up and his case is still before the courts. Schools such as Gifford and Milton high now not only compete academically and in sporting disciplines, they engage in violent fights. The situation is said to have been worsened by the disintegration of family and societal values.
Following Wayne’s killing, the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education yesterday held a stakeholders’ meeting at Townsend High School in the hope of coming up with lasting solutions to the problem.
School heads, senior teachers, parents, police, civil society organisations attended the meeting which also included pupils. <img class="size-large wp-image-685261" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/uikhjkj-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/uikhjkj.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/uikhjkj-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The meeting was covering schools from Bulawayo Central District which include Milton, Hamilton, Founders, Eveline, Gifford, Townsend and Montrose high schools.
