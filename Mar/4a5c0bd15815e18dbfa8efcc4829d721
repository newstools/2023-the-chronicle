The Chronicle Flora Fadzai Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter AS the world commemorated International Women’s Day running under the theme, “Digital Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality” yesterday, Mrs Maginess Ndlovu from Gwanda designed animations and drawings to highlight how women can be protected from digital abuse, which she showcased at the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo. She said many times, women shy away from taking up leadership positions in the country as they are scared of being bullied and assaulted online by their opponents. Her animations and drawings demonstrated to people, especially women, how the digital world should be made safer for women so that they can safely engage online. She was among six other artists who showcased their designs, all articulating the same message in different ways, as part of International Women’s Day commemorations in Bulawayo.  The commemorations were hosted by the African Union for Women in partnership with the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo, Msasa Project, and the African Women Leaders Network (AWLN). AWLN in Zimbabwe localised the theme to focus on raising awareness and formulating strategies to address online violence through interactive art. The hosts stressed how women had to be digitally empowered so that they feel safe while engaging on digital spaces and encourage women participation in business and politics. According to Plan International, girls and women often have less access to technology and the internet compared to boys and men because of the fear of being discriminated against online. Statistics show that women in some parts of the world are 26 percent more likely to own a mobile phone than men.
Research further highlights how without equal access to technology and the Internet, girls and women are not able to equally participate in digital societies, which negatively impacts countries’ potential for economic growth. “The world has become digital and we all need to work online. But a lot of women shy away from using online platforms because of the dangers that come with it. In my drawings, I clearly articulated how every negative thing should be shut down on social media so that women can safely be involved. <img class="size-large wp-image-687692" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/vsfwesd-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/vsfwesd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/vsfwesd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Women ‘s day celebrations at the Art Gallery. In one of the drawings, there’s a woman who is shouting from outside the window using a speaker telling everyone that they should stop abusing women in the digital world and on the other side of the window there’s a woman who is smiling and happy, clearly showing how shutting out all the negative things from the Internet helps women,” said Mrs Ndlovu. She said women are often abused by both men and women on the Internet as they are body shamed and negative information is spewed about them. She urged women to be the first to make the digital world safe for other women so that men can also follow suit.
“Growing up, I’ve always loved drawing and being creative. I have always been artistic. I do beads and clothing designs. I didn’t know how to do art using digital equipment until I saw an advert calling for women to apply so they can be taught how to do art using digital equipment. I applied and was happy when I was told I had been successful. That’s when they taught us how to do the animations. We finished the training in four days and I was happy with the work I had done in such a short space of time,” said Mrs Ndlovu. The art creator said she hopes to get a chance to do something bigger in order to advocate for women’s empowerment through her art. Speaking at the commemorations, United Nations deputy country representative Mrs Loveness Makonese said the celebrations are an opportunity to honour women and the roles they play in their lives. <img class="size-large wp-image-687683" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/dfesryjhmnn-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/dfesryjhmnn.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/dfesryjhmnn-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Women ‘s day celebrations at the Art Gallery. She said women are afraid to come out in the digital world and be discriminated against as they suffer from online abuse and harassment. “We’re working towards making the digital world safe for all women who want to use it because in order for us to achieve equality, women should be able to use the digital world freely without being troubled. “We’re working towards confronting online bullying against women, especially those in politics using art as it’s a very powerful weapon that can help to achieve the goal we’re looking at. Women are afraid to do something as simple as posting their pictures because of the sexist comments that will follow. The negative comments end up affecting even the social lives of the people who have been targeted,” said Mrs Makonese. She urged people to make the digital world a safe space for everyone.
Speaking on behalf of Bulawayo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Judith Ncube, the Director of Co-ordination in the Office of State and Devolution Bulawayo Province Mrs Botsoarelo Noko said the commemorations help everyone to deliberate on how to effectively address and combat online and ICT facilitated gender-based violence, which hampers women’s effective participation in politics. She said this will help in promoting women’s leadership in line with the future provisions of the Constitution of Zimbabwe. -@flora_sibanda
