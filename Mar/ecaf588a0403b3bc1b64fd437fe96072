The Chronicle Mbulelo Mpofu, Showbiz Reporter IN the early 2000s, there was a couple that kept viewers glued to their television sets, giving them primetime viewing pleasure. Patrick Mabhena who played the Mpofu character, husband to Mafuyane — a role played by Lindiwe Khumalo on ZBCtv drama Izolo Yizolo was a darling to many and a critical part of a golden generation of the film sector in Zimbabwe. The pair which had since disappeared from the screens is ready to relive that old-school type of loving on Saturday when they perform a theatrical piece at the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) building for a vintage-themed event curated by Younique Events, dubbed, “Ngiqome eSophia Town Jazz Night”. <img class="wp-image-685363 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hjngf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hjngf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/hjngf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chronicle Showbiz caught up with Mpofu and Mafuyane who expressed excitement and readiness at the prospect of working with young blood. “It’s a breath of fresh air to know that young people recognise what we do and are willing to learn how dating and courtship were done back in the day. I love working with young people and sharing my knowledge with them. “We (Mabhena and I) will be reciting love-charged poems as well as reliving Izolo Yizolo with a theatrical piece depicting how relationships were like in earlier times,” said Khumalo.  Mabhena bemoaned the deterioration of the moral, social, and spiritual fabric. “There’s a popular phrase nowadays, ‘Umjolo the pandemic’ that has been necessitated by how people relate to their partners, so on Saturday, we’ll be teaching and showing young people how being socially, morally, and spiritually sound helped us be the men and women that we are now. “Back in the day, matrimonial sanctity was intact, but with social media gaining ground, pure love has been distorted leading to the exchange of nude pictures, wrong ways of courtship and gender-based violence,” he added. <img class="wp-image-685357 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cxsd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cxsd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/cxsd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The pair alluded to yesteryear times when popular Choice Assorted biscuits, and a bottle of Tarino were perfect wooing materials, and men not only loved but also respected women. Event curator, Ntombezinhle Hadebe said preparations for the event are at an advanced stage and called upon youths to take this opportunity to learn from the experienced Khumalo and Mabhena. – @MbuleloMpofu
