FC PLATINUM coach Norman Mapeza thinks Bulawayo Chiefs will carry the same hunger as his side in tomorrow’s Castle Challenge Cup at Mandava Stadium. He said he is happy with his side’s preparations for the game. “So far so good with our preparations.  They are going very well. We are more than happy with what the guys have been putting in since we started our pre-season, the hard work which they have put in every day. I am more than happy. I can’t complain.  “Any game is a cup game whether it’s a league game or otherwise. Every game is important. Bulawayo Chiefs would want to win this for the first time and for us we also want to win this one for the fourth time. It’s an important game for us as an institution which is FC Platinum,” said Mapeza. Captain Petros Mhari also gave his thoughts on the game: “We all want to continue doing well since we have won this cup three times. We just want to do well in this competition.” <img class="wp-image-633532 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-46.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-46.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-46-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Petros Mhari One of their outstanding players from last season Brian Banda weighed in: “We will help each other as a team like we have done always.
