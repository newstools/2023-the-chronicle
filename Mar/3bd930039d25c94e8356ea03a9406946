The Chronicle Topping the charts this week is Uthando by Calvin Mangena.
Below is a brief profile of Calvin Mangena: Question: Please tell us about yourself.
Answer: I am an Amapiano artiste from Bulawayo, based in Esigodini. Q: How did you venture into music?
A: I was born into a family of music lovers. In 2018, that’s when I decided to take music seriously and started going to the studio to work on recording music.  Q: The song Uthando, what inspired it and who did you work with?
A: The song is more like a love letter. It’s funny to say, but I composed it as a letter to my lover. That’s where I got the whole idea and was able to draw some inspiration from the innocent love we shared. Q: Which music genre do you specialise in?
A: I specialise in Amapiano. Q: How many albums/EPs do you have?
A: I have four singles Ama German Tanker, Palessa, Dali and Uthando. <img class="size-large wp-image-480149" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Sjava2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Sjava2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Sjava2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sjava Q: Who inspires you?
A: The likes of Sjava, the late Bhekumuzi Luthuli, and of course Blaq Diamond. Q: Looking at our music industry, do you think promoters play a good role in developing local music or artistes?
A: I think it depends on the effort and work the artiste puts in. I’m sure if an artiste is relevant, promoters won’t have a problem playing big roles in their careers (promoting them). <img class="size-large wp-image-594571" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Blaq-Diamond-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Blaq-Diamond.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/Blaq-Diamond-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Blaq Diamond Q: What do you think artistes from the city should do to be recognised?
A: As artistes, we need to put in the work as much as possible and use the social platforms we have to our own advantage. This strategy is working for others in other countries hence it can also work for us too. We just need to put out good music. Good music is just hard to miss. – @eskhosini
