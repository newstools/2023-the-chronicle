In today’s world, where the job market is increasingly competitive and uncertain, many young people are taking matters into their own hands and creating their own employment opportunities. This is a trend that has been gaining momentum in recent years, as more and more young people realise that they can’t rely on traditional employment channels to provide them with a stable future. One such young person is Takudzwa Mushove, a 23-year-old from Cowdray Park, who has taken the bold step of starting his own branding company. His company, Bryan Darker Graphics, is slowly but surely making a name for itself in the industry, offering services like T-shirt and cup branding, banner and billboard design. Takudzwa’s journey to entrepreneurship started after he completed his O-levels in 2018. He began working for a local receipt branding company, where he learned the basics of branding and how to use various applications like X7. After almost a year at the company, he saved up enough money to buy his own laptop and printing machines, which are the basic tools needed for branding. <img class="size-large wp-image-688380" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/xcvbh-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/xcvbh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/xcvbh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> TAKUDZWA MASHOVE – YOUTH OWNING A BRAND He then decided to leave the company and look for one that focused on what he was doing. That’s when he found Inspirational Media and Graphics, where he worked for a while and learned everything he needed to know to run his own company. “I decided to look for a company that focuses largely on what I am doing. That is how I found myself at Inspirational Media and Graphics,” he says. Last March, Mushove took the plunge and left his job to start his own company. Despite not having landed any big projects yet, he is proud of the exposure he is getting and is happy to be able to offer branding services to other businesses. “It’s all about being out there and being visible. My time will come. I will catch the big fish,” he says.  Mushove believes that young people should not be ashamed of accepting help and mentorship. He says if it weren’t for the people who helped him along the way, he would still be sitting at home doing nothing. He encourages other young people to create their own employment opportunities and to accept help when it is offered. However, Mushove also acknowledges that starting a business is not easy. He says young entrepreneurs need to be patient and be prepared to face challenges along the way. “There are a lot of challenges that one comes across as a businessperson. As it is I am looking for a bigger place to operate from, however, with the rental costs that are high it becomes hard for one to be okay with moving. Also getting people to trust your brand is hard and needs someone to be honest and a good negotiator,” says Mushove. Despite these challenges, Mushove remains optimistic about the future of his business and encourages other young people to take the leap and start their own ventures. With hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn, he believes that anyone can succeed in the world of entrepreneurship.
