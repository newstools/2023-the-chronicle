The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Matabeleland South Bureau Chief AGRICULTURAL experts have urged farmers to embrace organic crop and livestock farming as it helps to increase production at a low cost and also promotes sustainable farming which protects the environment. Government through the Agricultural Rural Development and Advisory Services has scaled up training on various organic farming practices as part of efforts to promote climate-smart agriculture and boost food production.
In general terms, organic farming is an agricultural system that uses ecologically based pest controls and biological fertilisers derived largely from animal and plant wastes and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. <img class="wp-image-586858 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-12-copy-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-12-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Untitled-12-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Livestock Farmers in Matabeleland South are producing organic liquid manure, which also acts as a top dressing fertiliser and pesticide.
The manure is environmentally friendly and also cuts the cost of buying pesticides. Most farmers are now using this liquid manure which is a well-decomposed cowdung as opposed to artificial fertilisers such as Compound D or Ammonium Nitrate. (AN)
Farmers are also growing fodder to provide organic supplementary feed to their animals as a substitute for synthetic feeds. This has helped farmers to cut the costs of buying commercial stockfeed. Matabeleland is an arid region and most farmers depend on livestock farming.
Some farmers are also using dried marula fruit skin to feed their small livestock. Organic crop farming relies on crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control.  Farmers involved in organic farming have to adopt conservation farming to preserve soil in order to get the most out of it.
Acting provincial director of Agricultural Rural Development and Advisory Services for Matabeleland South, Mr Mkhunjulelwa Ndlovu said the National Development Strategy (NDS1) speaks to environmental protection and hence Government encourages farmers to practice organic farming. He said organic farming is a sustainable way of improving agro-ecology as opposed to using expensive chemicals and fertilisers.
Mr Ndlovu said organic farming involves the use of natural remedies which do not contain chemicals that can be harmful to the land, water bodies and species.
“Organic farming practices are recommended as they outperform conventional farming during drought. Organic solutions don’t release toxic chemicals and they help farmers to serve while recording good yields,” he said. <img class="wp-image-633454 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/crops.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/crops.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/crops-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Crops farming Mr Ndlovu said when farmers use liquid manure which acts as top dressing fertiliser and pesticide, they do not worry about buying pesticides or top dressing fertiliser.
He said liquid fertiliser also helps retain moisture and soil nutrition making it environmentally friendly.
“Organic manure contains micro-organisms which retain the nutritive value of soil. These organic components are readily available within communities and farmers have to utilise them,” he said. Mr Ndlovu said Government intends to move away from the use of synthetic products in farming. He said agricultural extension officers are educating and training farmers about the importance of organic farming to the environment.
Mr Ndlovu said farmers are responding well as they are appreciating the benefits of organic farming. <img class="wp-image-609070 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-copy-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-copy-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Untitled-3-copy-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fertiliser “Farmers who are realising great benefits from organic farming are those farmers who have been struggling to produce in dry areas,” he said
Mr Ndlovu said farmers that are using organic supplementary feed are getting good value from their animals.–@Dube-Matutu
