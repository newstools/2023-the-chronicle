MINING stakeholders are calling for regulations that would make it compulsory for mining firms to process mineral ore at mine sites. At present, most miners are processing mineral ore at a separate location from mining sites depriving locals of employment opportunities. The sentiments were raised on Tuesday at a local hotel in Bulawayo where mining players and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development had a public consultation meeting to gather views on the Mines and Minerals Bill.  Speaking at the hearing, Mr Lovemore Risere said there is a need for investors to process mineral ore at the mining sites rather than taking the ore and processing it somewhere leaving locals stranded and paying hefty fines for the damage that would have been caused on the land. “The investors are taking ore and they are not even crushing it at mining sites. “We don’t even know where they are taking this ore to but we are the ones given heavy penalties. The Government should not permit investors to take the ore outside the country, instead the processing should take place at the mining sites. “The very same people in the same place should benefit. Mining is supposed to be elevating the mining communities and also creating employment for young people who are now involved in drug abuse because they don’t have anything to keep them busy,” said Mr Risere. <img class="alignnone wp-image-459024 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Ministry-of-Mines-and-Mining-Development.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Ministry-of-Mines-and-Mining-Development.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/Ministry-of-Mines-and-Mining-Development-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development is on two-week public consultations, which started on 27 February and will end on 10 March. The consultations are meant to gather views on the Mines and Minerals Bill. Another player in the mining sector, Ms Fadzai Siziba said the Government should assist in the value addition of minerals by providing small-scale miners with processing equipment. “Government should assist small-scale miners with processing equipment.
“If the Government can do this, this will improve the mining communities and improve the livelihoods of people.” <img class="wp-image-687267 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/r.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/r.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/r-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stakeholders follow proceedings at a Mines and Minerals Bill hearing at a local hotel in Bulawayo. – Minister of State for Mashonaland East Provincial Affairs and Devolution Cde Apolonia Munzverengwi was in attendance at the hearing. Other stakeholders said more investors should partner small-scale miners in the value addition and beneficiation of minerals. They said the partnership between local miners and foreign investors will help to empower local people who don’t have the capacity to establish processing plants to beneficiate the minerals. “Our people can have mining claims and investors can come and establish processing plants. Locals will become suppliers of raw ore, and by so doing this is going to empower a lot of people,” said Mashonaland East Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Apolonia Munzverengi.
