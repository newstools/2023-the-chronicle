The Central Bank introduced the auction platform to improve productive sector accessibility to the much-needed forex. The auction system continues to provide affordable and easily accessible foreign currency to the productive sector in a bid to reduce production costs and promote industrial growth as this reduces sourcing of forex from the illegal forex market, which manipulates exchange rates.
