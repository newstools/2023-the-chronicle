BEITBRIDGE Municipality and Musina Municipality in Limpopo Province, South Africa have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a twinning arrangement, paving way for the two local authorities to collaborate on key development issues. The two border towns, which are divided by the Limpopo River, share similar challenges emanating from their geographical locations. As part of the twinning arrangement, Beitbridge and Musina will co-operate in terms of managing pandemics and public health, water, sewer, and road infrastructure, among other amenities. The talks, which started last year, were finalised this week during a working visit by the Musina Municipality delegation to Zimbabwe led by their mayor Councillor Godfrey Mawela.  Beitbridge Mayor, Councillor Munyaradzi Chitsunge said they entered into an economic twinning arrangement which is a key enabler towards addressing service delivery challenges. “Due to the high transit population movement, the two local authorities will collaborate to manage public health, epidemics, pandemics and endemics. Technical teams from the two councils have started working on the necessary plans to fully implement the terms of the MoU,” said Clr Chitsunge. “We need a set-up where we grow together economically, socially, and culturally. As a local authority, we envisage a set up where some South African companies invest and take up space in our special economic zone facilities”. Among other key issues under consideration is an agreement where Beitbridge Municipality would resume exporting water to Musina. <img class="size-large wp-image-603420" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Beitbridge-mayor-councillor-Munyaradzi-Chitsunge-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Beitbridge-mayor-councillor-Munyaradzi-Chitsunge.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Beitbridge-mayor-councillor-Munyaradzi-Chitsunge-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge mayor, councillor Munyaradzi Chitsunge Clr Chitsunge said the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) will have to come in with the necessary legal and modalities framework. He said there is a need for the two councils to co-operate in tackling some of the cross-cutting issues revolving around cross-border crime and public health. Beitbridge town clerk, Mr Loud Ramakgapola said the MoU covers a number of areas where they need to cooperate and share ideas. “We are only separated by the Limpopo River, yet we share common challenges. So, we have agreed on a number of issues and the MoU covers exchange programmes including the development of small to medium enterprises and sharing calendars of events,” he said. “Some of the major events include trade fairs, Marula Festival, Musina Annual Show, Beitbridge mayor’s anti-litter marathon, the two countries marathon, annual budget speeches”. Mr Ramakgapola said they also agreed on creating joint women and youth entrepreneurs’ networks. <img class="size-large wp-image-624964" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-51-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) “We will also be co-operating on the development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) which fall under the jurisdiction of both councils. The other areas under consideration include the strengthening of cultural and educational programmes,” he said. Clr Mawela said as part of their adopted action plan, Musina Local Municipality will prioritise issues of water infrastructure “We are glad that this mutually beneficial bilateral co-operation we have is not only on paper, but we have already seen tangible evidence that our collaboration is paying off. These two municipalities recognise the spirit of a framework of co-operation in order to enhance the common aspirations of our people,” he said. “We have water challenges back home and we have realised that here in Beitbridge, you have good infrastructure, which we can be replicated.” Clr Mawela said as part of the infrastructure cluster, Musina Municipality is interested in sharing best practices and technical know-how, research and development, policy development on sustainable infrastructure and development for socio-economic growth. He said it is important for the two councils to use their collaboration to empower citizens from both countries with skills.
Clr Mawela said under the agreement they will also promote peace, human capital, promote cooperation, and cultural development. “South Africa, and Musina in particular, recognises itself as an integral part of the African continent and therefore understands its interest as being intrinsically linked to Africa’s stability, unity, and prosperity. Through our memorandum of understanding, we can be able to welcome Africa’s return to a path of stability and prosperity, and remain committed to co-operation and partnership for the sake of our future generations,” he said.–@tupeyo
