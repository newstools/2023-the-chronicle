The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau A TRUCK driver carrying an assortment of groceries is on the run after driving off at the Beitbridge Border Post before engaging in a 250km high-speed chase with security agents. The man, Wonder Muswere, allegedly hit the traffic control boom to escape with a truck carrying the contraband on Wednesday last week soon after being referred to the container depot for physical examinations. Muswere intended to smuggle the goods after undervaluing the consignment. He was in turn referred to the container depot by Zimbabwe Revenue Authority officials and the security following a tip-off.  Instead, he decided to flee with the goods after realising he was cornered. A security source within the Ferret  squad at the border said the man hit the traffic control boom at the border and another at the Lutumba toll gate along the Beitbridge to Masvingo road. “He also hit the drums at a security roadblock in Bubi while involved in a high-speed chase with the anti-smuggling team,” said the official. “The suspect was chased from the border up to the Renco Mine area along the Ngundu to Chiredzi Road. He pulled off the road and escaped on foot. <img class="wp-image-669224 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/beitbridge-border-post-1.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/beitbridge-border-post-1.png 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/beitbridge-border-post-1-360x200.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Beitbridge-border-post “The vehicle has since been seized and is in Chiredzi. We also seized another truck from the same company with horse AEZ9313 and two trailers, AEZ9666 and AEZ9663.” The official said the truck was carrying similar goods and is being kept at the Beitbridge container depot. The two trucks were destined for Harare and further investigations into the matter are in progress. The Zimbabwe Republic Police yesterday said that they were still pursuing Muswere and appealed to anyone with information to contact the nearest police station. “The police and other security agencies pursued and impounded a 30-tonne truck, with a Volvo horse registration numbers AFJ0039 towing two trailers AEZ9662 and AEZ9665,” said the police in a statement. “The driver of the vehicle, Wonder Muswere is currently on the run and investigations are underway. We are appealing to anyone with information on the whereabouts of Muswere to contact the nearest police station”. It is understood that the State is losing a lot of potential import and export revenue to syndicates, which are using commercial trucks and buses both cross-border and intercity to evade customs regulations. <img class="alignnone wp-image-636073 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/MONEY-RANDS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/MONEY-RANDS.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/MONEY-RANDS-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Our Beitbridge Bureau understands that the worst affected area is the Beitbridge Border Post where rackets are illegally shipping in commercial goods through buses to evade import duty. Investigations reveal that most of the goods mainly groceries, alcoholic, and banned substances such as restricted cough syrups, and genetically modified foods are destined for supermarkets and tuck shops nationwide. As it stands, the bus crews, are reportedly bringing the goods abusing the travellers rebate facility, which allows a person to import basic goods not exceeding US$200 or R3 000 per each first entry into the country once monthly. Under the customs laws in cases, where one bringing goods worth more than US$200, they are charged duty of between 15 and 40 percent  depending on the commodity and set tariffs. – @tupeyo
