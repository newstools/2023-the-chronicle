It’s literally to celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women,” she said. The talented singer said she celebrated women’s day at a private event in Harare celebrating other women that have also conquered all the discrimination they have received as women in the arts sector. “I feel like the industry is still male dominated and women are still shadows of males out there. It’s rare for women in the creative space to headline shows. We still see posters crowded by males as if there aren’t better female performers. Let us also have women being the main act in the events. This will also give women draw more attraction on their work,” she said.  -@millieythandile
