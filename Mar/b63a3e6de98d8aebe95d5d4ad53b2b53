STAR all-rounder, Sikandar Raza is set to take part in Zimbabwe’s three match One Day International (ODI) cricket series against Netherlands set to start on March 21 at Harare Sports Club. Raza, who missed Zimbabwe’s T20I series against Ireland in Harare and the Chevrons’ Test series against West Indies in Bulawayo last month confirmed through his social media platform that he will be available when the Dutch come over for the first time since last year’s T20 World Cup Qualifiers which were held in Bulawayo. “Can’t wait to join the Chevrons for the series, dear Zimbabweans I shall be there InshaAllah (God willing) for the series. See you all soon,” he posted on his Twitter responding to ZC’s tour confirmation.  The three matches will take place on March 21, 23 and 25, with the fixtures part of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League that is serving as the main route for direct qualification for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 in India. The 13-team league competition will see the top eight sides, including India as the hosts, earn direct qualification, while the remaining five, along with five Associate sides, will play in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023 in Zimbabwe from which two other teams will go through to the global showcase. Both teams are out of contention for direct qualification to the World Cup, however, Zimbabwe white ball captain, Craig Ervine believes the series remains significant to them. Raza is playing in the ongoing eighth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) for the defending champions, Lahore Qalandars. The Zimbabwean star has been an integral part of the team and last week, after his heroics with the bat, was honoured for his contribution to the team’s victory. <img class="wp-image-674175 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/oqwas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/oqwas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/oqwas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Craig Ervine The 36-year-old was awarded a piece of land in Pakistan, the country where he was born after helping the Qalandars win by 17 runs against Quetta Gladiators on March 2.
