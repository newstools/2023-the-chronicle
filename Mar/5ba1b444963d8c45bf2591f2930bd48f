A LOCAL information communication technology (ICT) solutions firm, Utande, has embarked on an expansion programme that will see the company penetrating the regional market. The company already has branches in Harare, Bulawayo, and Mutare and recently opened a new branch in Kwekwe. It also looks to open another branch in Zvishavane. In a speech during a meet and greet business meeting to mark the official opening of the Kwekwe Branch recently, chief executive officer, Mr Never Ncube, said the company was in the process of laying a fibre connection from Beitbridge to Harare in a bid to improve connectivity.  “We embarked on an US$8 million expansion project to bring infrastructure from Beitbridge to Harare and this is expected to be complete by mid-June,” he said. “We want to be able to carry our own bandwidth from Beitbridge to Harare with ease.” Mr Ncube said the company has set its eyes on spreading wings across Southern Africa. “We are incorporating companies in South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique and Botswana among others so that we can start offering services in those countries,” he said. “Our vision is obviously going beyond the country’s borders as we look set to spread wings across the Sadc region.” <img class="size-large wp-image-588610" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Sadc-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Sadc.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Sadc-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> THE Southern African Development Community (Sadc) Mr Ncube said in some countries like South Africa, operations were already going through partnerships with other companies.
