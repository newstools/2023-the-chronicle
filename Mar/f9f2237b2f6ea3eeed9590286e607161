The Chronicle Amanda Manyayi, Opinion They say what you don’t know doesn’t kill you, but the reality is, what you don’t know won’t benefit you.
Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. It is not a formula or program but rather a human activity that comes from the heart and considers the hearts of the masses. Through EDworks, the ethos, aims, aspirations and objectives of our heroes and heroines who fought for the liberation of our country are being upheld. It is the effort of Zimbabwe’s champion of development, President Mnangagwa and the Second Republic leading the country towards a prosperous upper middle income economy by 2030.  These developments are meaningless if unexplained in layman terms to accommodate all Zimbabweans in line with the President’s agenda of “leaving no one and no place behind.” We have decided to take it upon ourselves to decode and explain the meaning of what our President is doing for our beloved Zimbabwe. Over the next weeks, we will explain what each development initiated by President Mnangagwa means for Zimbabweans, the nation and other countries. As a result of the engagement and re-engagement drive spearheaded by the Second Republic under the able leadership of President Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe is being built brick by brick. It has produced a balance of innovation and stability in a number of sectors such as agriculture that has been boosted by the Zimbabwe-Belarus farm mechanisation program. There is increased determination to chase fortunes bearing fruits of numerous life changing projects across all sectors. President Mnangagwa is going above and beyond daily in taking Zimbabwe from strength to strength. His fixation with national development has seen him taking infrastructure refurbishment on a trajectory there for all to see. Talk of the speeding up of the Harare-Bulawayo highway dualisation, widening of the Beitbridge-Harare highway and state-of-the-art development of the Mbudzi traffic interchange, our roads have a bright future ahead. Construction of the new Parliament building in record time and modernisation of the Beitbridge Boarder Post for smooth traffic flow has really sent a loud message where infrastructural development is concerned. <img class="wp-image-678158 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sw233.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sw233.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/sw233-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Construction of the Dinson Iron and Steel Company (Disco) in Manhize, Chirumhanzu District in the Midlands Province In spite of the national electricity challenges Zimbabwe is going through, President Mnangagwa’s administration has been involved in increasing power supply to the national grid through the Hwange Power Station and various solar projects dotted nationwide. The Rural Electrification Agency has electrified key rural institutions and homes in areas such as Gokwe, Mberengwa, Zvishavane, Chipinge and Shurugwi. In the Midlands Province, revisiting of the education system, paving way for Education 5.0, establishment of innovation hubs and provision of computers to rural schools such as in Chiwundura shows the President’s vision for a refined, constructive and productive education system. The construction of a Covid-19 centre at the Gweru Provincial Hospital, the National Pathology Centre at Midlands State University and construction of a US$2 million state-of-the-art Zvishavane District Hospital private ward, proves beyond any doubt President Mnangagwa’s commitment to improve the healthcare delivery system. The construction of dams such as Mvuma dam, bridges in Gokwe and the Senga housing project has seen the President being recognised as a dedicated Zimbabwean citizen prepared to get things done.
The provision of machinery at Lesaffre Zimbabwe, the establishment of an iron and steel plant in Manhize, the opening of industrial hubs and the provision of machinery at Bata Shoe Company conveys the Second Republic’s concern over the high unemployment rate in the country as well as the need to inject more into the national treasury. <img class="wp-image-586946 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/ZETDC.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/ZETDC.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/ZETDC-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZETDC The Government is determined to fulfil its mandate to the people of attaining an upper middle income economy by 2030. EDworks have indeed put Zimbabwe on the map so much that the progressive world can see and is expressing interest in investing in Zimbabwe. It is only incumbent on all Zimbabweans, progressive citizens of our motherland to exercise their right to vote this year with a well-defined, tried and tested leader in mind, a man striving to improve our lives in a positive trajectory despite the adversity of sanctions and hostile threats by enemies of progress masquerading as non-governmental organisations and opposition parties. As youths, we shall remain focused knowing that Rome was not built in one day. As Nelson Mandela said, “it all seems impossible until you start”. Indeed, through President Mnangagwa, we have started our journey as a nation and for as long as we breathe, Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.
