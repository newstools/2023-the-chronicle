The Chronicle Peter Matika, Online Desk A 47-year-old man from Bulawayo’s Entumbane suburb has been arrested for cultivating and supplying dagga. This follows an anti-drug campaign that seeks to prevent drug and substance abuse, as well as to weed out drug cartels and peddlers. According to Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube police acting from a tip-off from members of the public arrested Elliot Sitali (47) for cultivating a dagga tree measuring about 1.5 metres tall. “Concerned members of the public spotted a plant of dagga which was approximately 1, 5 meters tall growing in the accused person’s garden and made a police report as a tip-off. Police in Entumabne swiftly followed up on the tip leading to the arrest of Sitali. “Sitali was interviewed and admitted that he was the one who planted the tree for his personal use, as well as to supply the community with the drug. He was taken together with his plant to the police station where he is helping the police with investigations,” said Inspector Ncube. Inspector Ncube warned members of the public to desist from dealing in dangerous drugs as they would face the full wrath of the law. “We would like to appreciate the members of the public who helped the police with information that led to the arrest of Sitali. Police have upped the game in the fight against drugs and substance abuse hence people should be warned,” added inspector Ncube.
