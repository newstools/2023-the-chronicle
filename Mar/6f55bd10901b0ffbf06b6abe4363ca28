The Chronicle Tafadzwa Chibukwa, Chronicle Reporter Gym instructors are often the unsung heroes of the fitness world. While many people may only see the results of someone’s hard work, they do not always see the dedication and motivation provided by the instructors. <img class="wp-image-688463 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/fvfvvfvfd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/fvfvvfvfd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/fvfvvfvfd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gym instructors are often the unsung heroes of the fitness world. These individuals are more than just instructors, they are also coaches, therapists, counsellors, and teachers. They possess excellent communication and people skills and strive to create a safe and positive environment for their clients. Richard Chikwe, a gym instructor from Mpopoma, describes the profession as diverse and multi-translated. He believes that being a gym instructor is not for everyone, as it requires a great deal of pressure and expectations.  However, for those who have a passion for fitness, it can be a fulfilling and rewarding career.
“All I can say is that this is one critical job, not everyone is entitled or able to handle it. Generally, I can say it is for the chosen few among crowds of people. This job covers many aspects of life. Not only are we gym instructors but we are more like doctors, therapists, counsellors and teachers among many other professions that we touch on.
“Not only do we help train but we teach, motivate, encourage, guide and transform people into any size or shape. <img class="wp-image-688462 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/qszasadas.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/qszasadas.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/qszasadas-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gym instructors (2) Richard Chikwe Now you see that with the many pressures and expectations that the job comes with, it is not one that can be handled by someone who is idle. That which has been seen as cast off or lost hope, we redeem and bring life to it, which is why I say we are the chosen few among many,” said Richard.
Tapiwa Zimhamba, a fitprenuer who studied accounting, discovered that something was missing from his equation. He found fulfilment in the gym and pursued his passion by studying Sports science and Personal training courses in South Africa. Tapiwa has big dreams of opening multiple gyms in the country and abroad to impact as many people as possible. <img class="wp-image-688461 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gfdgfgh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gfdgfgh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gfdgfgh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gym instructors (3) left Tapiwa Zimhamba right Richard Chikwe “Even though I knew accounting had a lot of money, to me, it came with no fulfilment. As someone who was hooked on the gym and particular about my health and keeping fit, I decided to try out possibilities and go for my passion. That is when I started training people. “I would like to one day open multiple gyms in the country, as well as abroad in Africa then branch out internationally. My goal is to impact as many people relating to their health as possible. As someone aiming high I am not sitting idle, but I am starting to get celebrities to get in touch with me wanting my services and I am now training more of corporates like Access Forex, Yanaya and others that prefer to be kept private which is a step towards achieving my goals,” he said. <img class="wp-image-688459 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gtfrgrtgrg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gtfrgrtgrg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/gtfrgrtgrg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tapiwa has big dreams of opening multiple gyms in the country and abroad to impact as many people as possible. For Mehluli Moyo, gym is not only about hitting iron. It’s also about the interactions, socialisations, and relationships that are created in the gym. He believes that gym instructors and fitness models deserve the same recognition as their counterparts abroad. “People may underestimate what we do and think that we might be wasting our time but this is where our hearts are centred. I cannot spend a day without going to the gym that would really be an abomination. I have taken gym personally to a level that it now controls my diet, way of thinking as well as behaviour, I can just say gym is therapeutic,” he said. <img class="wp-image-688456 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hyuijtfy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hyuijtfy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hyuijtfy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gym instructors (5) Tapiwa Zimhamba Gym instructors are the chosen few who are dedicated to building up others, motivating them to do better, and transforming them into their best selves. They are passionate about their work and strive to make a positive impact on the world, one client at a time.
