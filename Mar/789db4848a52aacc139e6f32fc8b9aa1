A new talent search, Star Africa, which is aimed at giving young people a platform for self-expression through musical art and eradicating drug abuse in Bulawayo, is set to host its inaugural auditions in April with up to R150 000 (approximately US$8 300) up for grabs. Star Africa will have its auditions running for two months, with hundreds of hopeful performers from the city expected to try their luck at the contest up to the final stage where a single winner will be crowned. The targeted up-and-coming creatives must be aged between 13 to 30, with the main top three winners expected to sign a recording deal that will be complemented by a local and international music distribution deal. The winner is set to walk away with the prize money.  Founder of Star Africa, Nicolette Mdluli said: “Star Africa is a Zimbabwean music talent show which will have its first edition produced in Bulawayo. It’ll feature aspiring artistes from the City of Kings with artistes from other cities also welcome. Our target is youths who are students and those that are already getting started in music, with their age ranging from 13 to 30, who are looking to get into music as a career,” Mdluli said. “The goal of this show is to activate local communities into musical art and build communities that take pride in consuming local content. Another goal is to give young people a platform for self-expression through musical art. We’re also working to keep young people from using drugs.” <img class="wp-image-684309 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Illicit-drugs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Illicit-drugs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Illicit-drugs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Illicit drugs She said the contest will have its content broadcast on television. “The production is set for television.
