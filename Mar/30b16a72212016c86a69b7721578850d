The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter ONESIMO Matanga (48) is a man full of regret, he blames himself for the wrong decision he made when he was a teenager. The ex-Hamilton High School student was a gang leader in the 1990s. His gang was named the Dangerous National Army (DNA). It operated in eastern suburbs at a time when Star Force was a force in western suburbs. The recent killing of Wayne Ndlovu, a Founders High School pupil by a 17-year-old peer from Hamilton High School has brought back memories that Matanga wishes he could forget for good. <img class="wp-image-686226 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-3-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-3-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Msitheli High school violence “The reason why I’m interested in telling my story is that I was a gangster and gang leader. I was beating up other children. I’m now a grown man but I realise that gangsterism was a waste of time in my life. It was a setback in my life. I’m now fearing for the youngsters who are following the same path. “My message to the youngsters is that they must stop this gangsterism thing. Alcohol and drugs will destroy you. It may seem nice for that time but for the future and the long run, it is not worth it. I was a gang member for about 10 years to 15 years.” Matanga said his gangster lifestyle started when he was still at Hamilton High School. He hopes the unfortunate death of Wayne will stop the rot which seems to be inherited by every generation.  “We used to bunk lessons, take drugs, drink alcohol and then do bad things and this continued until we left school. I was actually the leader of the gang. Its name was called the Dangerous National Army. When we were growing up, there used to be a lot of gangs. There was Terror 10, Star Force and TTC, all in Bulawayo and we used to fight against each other,” he said. “There used to be guys like Star Force, those used to rob pupils, taking satchels, bus fare, hats and that is when parents from the eastern suburbs asked us to assist. The parents also joined in. We started just as a protection gang but we ended up being a terror gang.” <img class="wp-image-686202 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-13.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-13.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-13-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Onesimo Matanga-Former Hamilton Gang leader Matanga said after he finished school he became a drug dealer and peddled drugs to pupils, a move that he deeply regrets. He says decisive interventions need to be implemented to address the gang violence issues in school. “In my opinion, I think this is more spiritual. It needs some people to intervene. It’s just passing from one generation to another. By the time I was doing it, someone had done it before and it seems to be a never-ending cycle,” said the ex-convict Matanga who once found himself behind bars for living a life of crime. Prison made him change his ways but his life is not rosy and he blames his teenage experiences for the misfortunes. “Even now people still don’t trust me, although I have changed, it’s hard for the community to accept. I can’t find a job. Being in the gang gave me bad luck; I got my Class 2 driver’s licence but I simply can’t get a job. I can’t get a job even as a general hand. So, I have started a car wash in Barham Green shops just to make a living. <img class="wp-image-686337 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/The-aftermath-of-violent-skirmishes-inset-at-Msitheli-High-School-in-this-file-photo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/The-aftermath-of-violent-skirmishes-inset-at-Msitheli-High-School-in-this-file-photo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/The-aftermath-of-violent-skirmishes-inset-at-Msitheli-High-School-in-this-file-photo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The aftermath of violent skirmishes (inset) at Msitheli High School in this file photo Life is hard and I look at the other guys I was in school with. They are living nicely and I’m suffering,” said Matanga. As a result of his life choices, Matanga has struggled to settle down. He has six children with five different women. In spite of his misfortunes, Matanga believes he is one of the lucky ones as most of his members are dead and buried. “This is why I’m trying to tell these boys to get their thing straight because for my life to get back on track I would need to hit a jackpot. I really messed up my life. Most of the guys I was in the gang with lived very short lives. I think I’m one of the last men standing. Most of the guys who were in my gang, including rivals, are now dead. Some were shot in South Africa,” he said. Matanga believes weeding out drug dealers will go a long way in ending gang violence in schools. “There is a need to get rid of drug dealers. Drug dealers are known but they tend to get away with it but we all know them.” – @nqotshil
