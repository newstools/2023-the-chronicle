VALLEY Irrigation Scheme farmers in Matobo, who are pioneers of pecan nut farming in the country, have started exporting their produce to South Africa. Pecans are nuts from a tree that is native to North America. Mexico is the world’s largest pecan producer followed by the United States. Wild pecans were a major food source for indigenous peoples in North America. The nuts have a sweet, nutty flavour and can be eaten fresh, roasted, and used in all kinds of recipes, particularly desserts. They can be used to produce a number of edibles including pies, candies, cookies, bread, corn cakes and even relish soup.  The pecan nut trees in Matobo are said to have reached early maturity after they started producing fruits in two years as opposed to eight, which is expected. Their early maturity has been attributed to favourable soils and weather conditions in Matabeleland South. Donkwe Donkwe villagers started pecan nut farming in 2020 after being informed of the potential revenue they can generate from the project. The community started the project after receiving the seed from a Zimbabwean who lives in the United States. <img class="wp-image-686997 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hggg7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hggg7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hggg7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kezi Valley Irrigation Scheme -Centre pivot The irrigation members numbering 200, planted nearly 20 000 seeds in 2020 and have started harvesting the fruits. A Chronicle news crew last visited Matobo and observed that most of the pecan nut trees were ready for harvesting. The community said they have since attracted a South African buyer who buys their nuts. The farmers operate at Valley Irrigation Scheme, but the group within that scheme involved in pecan nuts is operating under the name Phezulu Farmers, to differentiate themselves from others who are also into pecan farming. <img class="wp-image-686982 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/uiyy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/uiyy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/uiyy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kezi Valley Irrigation Scheme Peacan Nuts project-workers Phezulu Farmers secretary Mrs Silayezelo Moyo said when they started the project in 2020, they did not expect returns this early. “We were told that the trees will start producing nuts after about eight years but within two years, the trees were now producing nuts. When we started planting the trees, we were simply looking ahead so that our grandchildren would benefit by earning a living from the trees. We saw it as a long-term project, but we were surprised to see the trees starting to produce fruits,” said Mrs Moyo. “We started supplying the pecan nuts to South Africa early last year. We got buyers who own restaurants and shops who buy our produce. However, we also have a vision to start supplying the pecan nuts to China because they are in demand in other countries.” She said at the moment they are not making much from the exports, because production is still in the early stages. Mrs Moyo said after exporting the nuts to South Africa they share proceeds. <img class="wp-image-686994 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/trhg44.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/trhg44.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/trhg44-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kezi Valley Irrigation Scheme Peacan Nuts project “We don’t get much money from supplying the nuts for now, but we get money that assists us in our everyday lives to buy food for our families and send our children to school. Also, some of the money we get we pay individuals we would have employed to assist us with working the orchard,” she said. The farmer said they are appealing to the Government to help them with funds to get proper machinery for watering the trees such as pipes and engines. Mrs Moyo said they are also saving funds from the money they get from exports, but it will take time for them to reach the targeted amount to buy machinery without Government’s help. <img class="wp-image-686990 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/lkjh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/lkjh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/lkjh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kezi Valley Irrigation Scheme -Centre pivot She said before the trees are planted, they are placed in a nursery for two years. “As Matabeleland South Province we are proud that we have something that is a wonder to the nation and we are the first and the top farmers to plant so many pecan nuts that are doing very well,” said Mrs Moyo. Phezulu Farmers project manager Mr Simbarashe Karapa said the tree originates from North America and it is a wild variety tree found in the bushes. He said it is of great importance for farmers who want to grow pecan nuts to be knowledgeable. “It would be of great loss if a tree with 60kg of pecan nuts falls due to poor planting, so farmers we must be aware. The pecan nut trees are not taxing because they are wild trees but we put a little bit of fertiliser and we water them to have the best produce and we use garden hoses and buckets. The trees are not eaten by termites. All termites that climb it don’t even attempt eating the tree leaves,” said Mr Karapa. <img class="wp-image-686979 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tytytytytytytydfcryed.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tytytytytytytydfcryed.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tytytytytytytydfcryed-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kezi Valley Irrigation Scheme Peacan Nuts project “Some men from South Africa who are friends with some of the farmers here came to the field for a tour because they were surprised that pecan nut trees have started to produce fruits at an early stage. They visited so that they could witness it and they were impressed to find some of the trees with about 50 fruits.” Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development chief director (Agricultural and Rural Development) Professor Obert Jiri last Thursday visited the community project and applauded the farmers involved for being pacesetters in revolutionising agriculture in the country. <img class="wp-image-686973 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hggtu5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hggtu5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hggtu5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kezi Valley Irrigation Scheme – Prof. Obert Jiri He said their move to divert from the common crops and fruits is what is expected to drive the rural industrialisation agenda. Prof Jiri attributed hot climate conditions and sandy soils for the early maturity of the pecan nuts. “Pecan nuts are an investment project that will be of great help to all the individuals that are going to live in the area because pecan nuts are a business that can last for more than 200 years and they will still be producing. Since Matabeleland has sandy soils and the area is hot, they did a good job of embarking on growing pecan nuts as the weather conditions favour the type of plant and they are doing very well,” said Prof Jiri. He said Government supports the community initiative as it is in sync with agricultural policies. — @NomqheleC
