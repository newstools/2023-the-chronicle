PREMIER Soccer League chief executive officer, Kennedy Ndebele has said while they expect to witness a blockbuster Castle Challenge Cup tie between FC Platinum and Bulawayo Chiefs set for Saturday at Mandava Stadium in Zvishavane, they cannot afford to compromise the safety and security of fans that will throng the venue. The cheapest ticket will be US$2 for the rest of the ground with fans who will watch from the VIP set to pay US$5. Reduction in gate charges is likely to draw a big crowd. Traditionally, PSL charges US$3 for the rest of the ground. The Castle Challenge Cup will mark the beginning of the 2023 season and Pure Platinum Play will be playing in their fourth Castle Challenge Cup while Amakhosi Amahle are making a maiden appearance.  “This is a season’s opener where we have the winners of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League championship playing against the winners of the Chibuku Super Cup. It’s going to be FC Platinum and Bulawayo Chiefs. So, as a curtain raiser, we are looking forward to an exciting game. For us, exciting means the fans are happy. We are therefore looking at the organisational set-up, how we organise and how the clubs organise for the safety and security of fans,” said Ndebele. <img class="wp-image-676517 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/pjjbkm.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/pjjbkm.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/pjjbkm-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kennedy Ndebele Last weekend, FC Platinum beat Masvingo United in two friendly matches played in the Ancient City.
