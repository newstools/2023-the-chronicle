He is being accompanied by the director of Africa-Middle East Mr Olatunyi Oyeyemi and advisor of JCI Africa-Middle East Mr Olajide Adeyemi. JC Zimbabwe national president Mr Samuel Takudzwa Nehumba said the organisation takes youths through a leadership journey and allow them to discover their true potential through activities, training and events. “Members are empowered to be active and be able to hold events like area conferences and world congress. Each region holds its own area conference and our last conference for Africa and the Middle East was in Tunisia last year,” he said. Mr Nehumba said JC Zimbabwe’s bid to host the Area Conference for Africa and the Middle East was supported by the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation and Zimbabwe Tourism Authority. The conference will be held under the theme: “Leadership, Resilience and Sustainability” and seeks to capacitate youths to be resilient and drive sustainable economies especially in times of shocks like during the Covid-19 pandemic. <img class="wp-image-466071 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/RS-Sims-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/RS-Sims-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/RS-Sims-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> RS (Sims Ncube), GP (Israel Matseke Zulu) and Tsibi (Sunday Mukandawire) during the video shoot in Bulawayo last year. — Picture by JCine Mr Nehumba said the conference was open even to non-members and is therefore expected to bring a lot of benefits not only to tourism but also to youths who will be empowered.
