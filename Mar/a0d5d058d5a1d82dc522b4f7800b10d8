Msendami benefited from an assist by Anthony Gouws. Three minutes before finding the back of the net, Msendami provided an assist for his team’s fifth goal scored by Elkanah Nyathi.

It was an exciting day in the office for everyone. We’re enjoying a good run and I’m happy to have been among scorers. I want to keep assisting and scoring. Finding the back of the net and providing assists boosts my confidence,” said the soft-spoken Msendami. The other goals for Msendami’s team were scored by Gift Moyo, a brace by Gaamagwe Sethibe, Wendell Rudath, Gilbert Baruti, Serati Semadi, Thabo Leinanyane and Doctor David.  Jwaneng Galaxy coach Morena Ramoreboli, who led South Africa’s Bafana Bafana to Cosafa Cup victory in 2021, was happy that his team progressed to the next round but felt they could have avoided conceding. Ramoreboli said former Highlanders midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku was guilty of giving away possession for the second goal they conceded. Masuku and Msendami started the match for Jwaneng Galaxy. <img class="alignnone wp-image-688772 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/sjdvjg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/sjdvjg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/sjdvjg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I’m not happy with the goals we conceded. We could have done better especially playing with these kinds of teams. We made mistakes leading to the goals we conceded, I think Masuku should have played the ball wide instead of centre leading to their second goal. But mistakes happen in football and I can’t crucify the boys. “Overall, I’m happy that we’ve progressed to the next stage of the competition,” said Ramoreboli. — @ZililoR.
