All they need is someone to listen to them,” he said. The director said he was proud to have helped many up-and-coming actors get a foot in the door. The actor, who has starred in shows such as City Ses’La and Ses’ Top La, said his production company was working on more movies and great shows. “We are carrying on with Black Door on e.tv,” he said. He also said he has collaborated with other industry experts in his academy, Black Brains Academy, to show young talents the ins and outs of the entertainment industry. Former actress Zikhona Bali told SunTeam that she has enjoyed every moment on the set of the show. “I played Asanda. It’s been a good two-year run. I had the privilege to work with people I’ve always wanted to work with. Regarding the last episodes, it’s Bittersweet,” she said. The actress said they had great storylines, a great cast, and a crew. <img class="alignnone wp-image-686158 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-3-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-3-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-3-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “But a new season with new opportunities is upon us,” Bali said. Actress Lebohang Mpyana who plays the role of Khelina said she is saddened by the show coming to an end as she has been with it for the longest time. “It started in 2020. I was there from day one shooting Diep City, and it was a beautiful experience as my dream came true. For me, it was an interesting journey. Now the show coming to an end, it is so painful because, for some of us, it was our bread and butter as we are breadwinners. But at the end, good things also come to an end,” she said. Lebohang said when the door closes another door opens. “I learned that everything is possible and hard work pays. Remember what’s yours will never miss you,” she said. The actress said people should expect more magic more creativity and more laughter. – DailySun
