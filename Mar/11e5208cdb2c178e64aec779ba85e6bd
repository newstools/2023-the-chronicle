Witnesses told the chronicle the vehicle was enroute to Luveve from Nkulumane.  The vehicle came to a stop straddling a drainage canal, which prevented it from hitting a perimeter wall at a nearby AFM Church near Konron supermarket. The news crew arrived after four ambulances had ferried the injured to hospital. <img class="alignnone wp-image-686245 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-14-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-14-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-14-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Passengers including school children sustained injuries and the conductor was said to be seriously injured, and he could not speak. “It is said that the kombi lost brakes and the driver tried to control the vehicle while also trying to avoid hitting other cars on the road. The drainage canal may have saved because if the car had hit the wall, there could have been fatalities,” said a woman who was at the scene. – @SikhulekelaniM1
