The Chronicle    Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HAVING been postponed to April 1, preparations for the 2023 edition of the Trysupps Zimbabwe-sponsored Novice Bodybuilding Championships are gathering momentum. Initially, the competition was scheduled for March 25 before it was moved to April 1. For the second year running, the competition is sponsored by men’s physique athlete Ryan Gumbo through his company TrySupps Zimbabwe in partnership with the National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness (NFZBBF). “We were forced to move after the unavailability of the venue which is the Zimbabwe College of Music on March 25. However, that has not derailed our planning process as everything is well on course. We expect to have participants from the entire country and the competition will be stiff. This tournament is just me inspiring the youngsters out there,” said Gumbo. Other events on the NFZBBF calendar this year include Mr and Ms Ironman, the annual Marume Classic, Mr and Ms Bulawayo and Harare Classic. Novice competition will be in the senior men’s bodybuilding, men’s physique, men’s fitness, junior men under-21 and women’s physique. – @innocentskizoe
