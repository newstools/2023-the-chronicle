The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Organisers of the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCA), MultiChoice and Africa Magic are ready to roll out the red carpets for another year of recognising the best African talent. African filmmakers have been urged to submit their movies and films publicly exhibited or broadcast between December 1, 2021, and January 31, 2023, for this year’s edition of the awards. “The entry portal opens on February 20, 2023, and closes on March 10, 2023. All films (aired in cinemas or otherwise), made-for-television movies or television series are eligible so long as they fall within the specified timeline,” MultiChoice said in statement.  To enter the awards, filmmakers must prepare a five-minute-long showreel. The video must be less than 300MB and submitted on the Africa Magic website. “The website will allocate a unique reference number to each completed online submission.”
Last year, Veza: The Unfolding, a Bulawayo-produced action thriller was nominated for the awards in the Best Movie in Southern Africa category. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-588844" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/film-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/film.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/film-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The ninth edition of the AMVCAs, slated for later in the year, will see the return of the social media category which fast-rising Nigerian comedian, Sabinus, took home last year. “The award tagged ‘Best Online Social Content Creator’ recognises the growing acceptance of content creators across Africa. There are also categories like the trailblazer and lifetime awards that are often emotional wins. “Fast-rising actors in the period under review will be looking forward to winning the trailblazer award, which will mark a major milestone in their career.” The fashion-forward ‘Best-dressed’ male and female categories are also set to return.
