From here we expect athletes to be kept in shape so that when they go to national finals there will be no injuries. Their diet should also be athletes’ diet. “No cheating will be tolerated and if ever there is any cheating, Nash regulations will be invoked as we want to come up with a strong Cossasa teams for the Under 15s and Under 17s and make our president (Arthur Maphosa) who is acting Cossasa president proud,” said Sibanda. <img class="alignnone wp-image-686627 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-46.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-46.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Untitled-46-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The provincial team will camp for two weeks at a school to be named. Matabeleland North Provincial Education Director, Jabulani Mpofu who was guest of honour warned athletes and pupils in general against using drugs. “Let me take this opportunity to tell you learners to be disciplined and desist from using drugs.
