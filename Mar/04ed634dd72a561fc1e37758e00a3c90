The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FRANCE-based Zimbabwe basketball national team captain Vitalis Chikoko says the country needs to play more games if they are to compete with Southern African giants that include Mozambique and Angola. Zimbabwe lost to Mozambique in the final of the Zone Six AfroCan qualifiers played in Bulawayo. The game ended 71-59 in favour of Mozambique who were the favourites to win the tournament.
The relatively new competition is meant for players playing in Africa but two slots are available for foreign players in each team.
Zimbabwe had Chikoko in one of those slots. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685683 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/dfgdgr.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/dfgdgr.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/dfgdgr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Following Zimbabwe’s loss to Mozambique, Chikoko said: “In the final Mozambique came at us. They were more aggressive on defence. They were ready for me today, they did not want me to get the ball.
I had two people on me each time I tried to get the ball. I think we played amazingly but we lost to Mozambique.” He said Mozambique is one of the best teams in Southern Africa but Zimbabwe managed to give them a hard time. <img class="wp-image-685685 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/qweqwrwer.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/qweqwrwer.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/qweqwrwer-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vitalis Chikoko (left) in a match between Zimbabwe and Mozambique “I believe we had a good tournament but we need to adjust as a country and improve on individual play. I am a team player, I play for my team and as such I don’t really care about scoring. When I see space, I pass the ball and I get rebounds. I try to do everything to help my teammates,” said Chikoko. He said the new super six league means hard work for team if it is to do well.
“I think we have to put in the work. We can’t relax and wait for the games to come. The next games we have are in July so we should keep working so that the next time we play the likes of Mozambique and Angola we will be ready.”  Chikoko is the closest any Zimbabwe player has come to playing in the NBA. The Harare-born star, who stands at 2,08m went undrafted in the 2013 NBA Draft but the Houston Rockets signed him for their summer league. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685688 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/45r4rerf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/45r4rerf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/45r4rerf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
He played four games but was released shortly after and he now plays professionally in France.
