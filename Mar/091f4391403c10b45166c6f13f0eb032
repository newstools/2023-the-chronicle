Most of the accidents that occur on the country’s roads have been attributed to human error. Speeding, misjudgment, overtaking error, failure to give way, following too close, reversing error, negligent pedestrians or cyclists and fatigue are human mistakes. Also, according to experts, night driving is far more dangerous than day-time driving — @ReeSibanda
