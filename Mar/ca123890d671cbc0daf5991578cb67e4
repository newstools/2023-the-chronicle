The Chronicle Brandon Moyo, Sports Reporter ENGLISH football giants, Manchester United showed their appreciation for one of their loyal and passionate fans, the late South African hip-hop superstar, Kiernan Forbes, otherwise known as AKA through a tribute message in their FA Cup match day programme. Super Mega, as Forbes was affectionately known was shot and tragically killed in Durban on February 10 and was mentioned in Manchester United’s obituary section of their match programme in their clash against West Ham last Wednesday at Old Trafford. Throughout the years, Forbes has been sharing his love and passion for the Red Devils, England’s most successful club and even had a tattoo of the United logo on his arm. He was also a huge fan of United’s strikers coach, Benni McCarthy and would post bet slips where he would be backing his beloved team to win matches, regardless of the opposition.  The English giants’ message was accompanied by a picture of the Super Mega in Manchester United regalia. “We were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Kiernan Forbes, otherwise known as AKA — a rapper and United supporter from South Africa. He was a huge red greatly admired by so many. Our thoughts are with his family and many loved ones,” read the tribute message. McCarthy appreciated his team’s tribute to the slain rapper, whom he was friends with. On his Instagram story, the South African great posted the cover of the Manchester United match day programme, with the caption: “FA Cup Match Programme with a nice mention for my brother AKA.” The Red Devils went on to win the match 3-1 to book a quarter-final date against another London-based side, Fulham. The match is scheduled to take place at Old Trafford on Sunday March 19. – @brandon_malvin
