The Chronicle Canditar Chapanduka, Features Reporter PRESIDENT Mnangagwa recently implored churches to complement Government efforts in fighting against drugs and substance abuse among youths, saying the church is an important stratum in society, which should lead from the front in nation-building and development. Drugs and substance abuse have increasingly become problematic among youths of late.
Three suspected drug dealers, one of them an ex-police officer, were recently arrested in Bulawayo following a raid at their homes in Entumbane suburb. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685718 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/4erwere.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/4erwere.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/4erwere-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Police recovered marijuana, alcohol, weight gain tablets and cough syrups among other illicit substances.
They also found pipes, which are used to inhale drugs, skin-lightening creams and plastic sachets, which are used to package drugs.
The arrests came a few weeks after about 17 youths from the suburb were rushed to Ingutsheni Central Hospital after overdosing on crystal methamphetamine (meth). <img class="wp-image-460425 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Ingutsheni-Central-Hospital-in-Bulawayo-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Ingutsheni-Central-Hospital-in-Bulawayo-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/Ingutsheni-Central-Hospital-in-Bulawayo-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ingutsheni Psychiatric Central Hospital In addition to churches, calls have been made for different stakeholders to work together in the fight against drug and substance abuse and Global Humanitarian Aid Trust (GHAT), a non-governmental organisation has heeded the call. GHAT is complementing Government efforts in the fight against drug and substance abuse by capacitating youths with life skills through various self-help projects. Established in 2019, GHAT strives to uplift youths and improve their livelihoods.
GHAT Chief Executive Officer Mr Munyaradzi Charuka said after living in conflict areas for 10 years, he had a global outlook on how children, especially youths, were affected by drugs, unfavourable economic conditions and wars. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685721 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/erwedwads.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/erwedwads.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/erwedwads-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I realised that something needed to be done to empower youths so that they are not affected by such situations and end up abusing drugs. Youths are the future so they need to be empowered to become better individuals,” said Mr Charuka. GHAT assists youths to establish sustainable businesses. “If we give them assistance, it should be in totality. They should also be willing to help themselves. Sometimes we come across youths who are not willing to leave the drug life or the life of being unemployed and they become reckless with the input we would have given them to start a business,” said Mr Charuka. A significant number of youths under GHAT are thriving, their businesses are expanding, allowing them to employ other youths.  “We have managed to help youths with start-up capital and we help them run the businesses until they’re ready to do it on their own. Even when the businesses grow and become strong, I remain their business partner because sometimes, some of the youths relax and leave the business to collapse,” said Mr Charuka. One of the beneficiaries, he said, started a mushroom project which is now funding his education.
Thandolwenkosi Moyo (23) from Richmond suburb started mushroom farming nine months ago and he has since registered his company, Purcha Investments, through assistance from GHAT. “I’m a student at Bindura University of Science Education studying Biomedical Science and through the proceeds from my business, I can afford to pay my tuition fees and take care of myself. The project has been really keeping me busy; I don’t have time for drugs, instead I’m always thinking about how I can grow my business,” said Moyo. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685722 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/fgrth.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/fgrth.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/fgrth-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> GHAT has also assisted youths in establishing businesses in detergent making, organic fertiliser manufacturing and kapenta selling. Another beneficiary of the organisation, Tevind Ndimande started an organic fertiliser manufacturing business. “I make liquid fertilisers through chicken manure fermentation. It has been very profitable such that the proceeds I get are enough to take care of my needs,” said Ndimande. Mr Charuka said his vision is to restore the dignity of disadvantaged youths in poor locations and promote openness. “We also cater for youths with disabilities who lack resources. Some of them come from poor families who sometimes exclude them from most activities and opportunities,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685725 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/54trgdrgf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/54trgdrgf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/54trgdrgf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Charuka said he identifies key problems affecting youths which he discusses with them.
During the conversations, he said, many of the youths display their capabilities which they fail to explore due to financial constraints. GHAT also capacitates the elderly, widows and housewives.
Mr Charuka said these groups create clubs through which they work together to grow their businesses and realise meaningful income. “There is a club in Cowdray Park suburb that was established for women called Simunye Club. We have managed to support the women by helping them start income-generating projects. We have provided them with raw materials to make detergents, petroleum jelly, cobra, and dishwashers among other projects. “We also bought them 50kg of kapenta so that they can repackage them into small plastics that they can sell and get profits which they share among club members. Once we support our beneficiaries with capital, the business funds itself as it grows,” he said. Mr Charuka said when women are empowered, their children have a better quality of life.
One of the members of Simunye Club, Mrs Rosa Chidoori said she appreciates the organisation for helping them start businesses as she can now provide for her family. “I don’t have to wait for my husband to buy everything at home because I now have the capacity to help him look after the family. In the club, we also assist each other to buy groceries and other household items that we share at the end of the year. GHAT has been of great help to us as women,” she said. @NomqheleC
