The Chronicle Mkhululi Ncube, Chronicle Reporter A MEGA fundraising campaign to mobilise resources for Plumtree District Hospital has been launched as part of efforts to boost health service delivery at the institution. The referral facility serves communities from Bulilima and Mangwe districts, as well as Plumtree Town.
Locals drawn from the two districts and the border town have come together to form the Plumtree District Hospital Donation Forum, a well-coordinated initiative to harness funds for financing the transformation of the hospital. Chairperson of the forum, who is also Plumtree Combined Residents Association chairperson, Mr Richard Khumalo, said they set a target of raising adequate resources within the next three months to pave the way for project implementation.
“This is not the first time we’re donating as residents as we managed to donate to Cyclone Idai flood victims in 2019. We also donated water pipes to Plumtree Town Council for George Silundika suburb,” he said. <img class="wp-image-552608 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/plumtree-town-council.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/plumtree-town-council.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/plumtree-town-council-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Plumtree Town Council “We sat down as residents from three areas and saw it fit to mobilise resources and boost service delivery at our hospital. The institution is critical as it is our referral centre for the two districts and serves Plumtree town as well. “We saw it fit to come together. Despite the fact that we may have clinics in our areas, all critical cases are referred to Plumtree District Hospital,” said Mr Khumalo.
He said a steering committee made up of members from the three areas has been set up for equal representation with the idea to mobilise support from all citizens.
Mr Khumalo said they had already engaged the hospital management over the programme and have also opened a bank account for the fundraising after being given some of the hospital’s pressing needs. “The donations will be channelled towards the list that we were given by the hospital. We are also addressing the food and nutrition side at the hospital which has a big piece of land where farming will be done,” he said.
“The hospital has a non-functional borehole, which was drilled at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and we will attend to it so that farming is done. Our aim is to boost quality service delivery at the hospital.  “Our fundraising campaign will run from February to May and we will review how far we would have gone and if there is a need, we may increase the time frame,” said Mr Khumalo.
He said they are also targeting businesses operating in and around Plumtree from which they will seek assistance.
Mr Khumalo said they had already started receiving funds and are using various social media platforms to enhance the campaign. “We have many of our children based in the diaspora and we are also courting them and they have promised to act especially on some of the equipment needed at the hospital,” he said.
“We are also making arrangements with our local government representatives to make sure that donations in kind from the diaspora do not pay duty at the border. We will be done with printing letters that will be sent to various stakeholders by tomorrow. “The money will be deposited to the bank and online payment platforms while some of the goods in kind will be handled by the Districts Development Coordinators’ offices.
“We are partnering with the Government in this because they built it for us and we can only assist them in its running.”
Mr Khumalo said those who wish to donate can use the accounts, which have been opened for the program. He said while donating is voluntary, it is important for residents to support the health centre as anyone may be a patient there.
“We have opened accounts with ZB Bank and for the ZW$ the account number is 4511 091859 200 while for the US$ account its 4511 091859-405. Those who wish to contribute via EcoCash our biller code is *151*2*2*032626 and it registers Plumtree Hospital. They can also alternatively get in touch with the fundraising committee on +263 772 851 342,” he said.– @themkhust
