Lately, Dr Muleya has been scooping awards in recognition of her business acumen. Last year, she was the first runner-up (Businesswoman of the Year 2022) at an awards ceremony held by the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC). “I got into business in 1999 with a modest barbershop at Living Waters Complex in Beitbridge town. This was after I realised that the community within the town and my son needed a barbershop with a steriliser, proper equipment, and a clean environment,” she said. <img class="wp-image-543469 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/NZCC.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/NZCC.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/NZCC-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> ZNCC “At that time, I was still employed as a controller by Allen Wack and Shepherd, a customs clearing agency until I resigned in 2000, and became a full-time businesswoman.” Dr Muleya said since then, her business empire started growing slowly. “I actually tried many projects and along the way, some were very successful and others failed and those became my life lessons and a stepping stone,” she said.

The company has become a force to reckon with in the freight forwarding sector. “At its inception, I became the finance director and 50 percent owner until today.
