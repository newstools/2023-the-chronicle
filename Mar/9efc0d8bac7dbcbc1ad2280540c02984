UNITED States of America-based Zimbabwean high jump star Kudakwashe Chadenga’s stock continues to rise after he managed to set a new facility record during the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) indoor championships held at Washburn Indoor Athletic Facility in Topeka, Kansas. The competition held at the weekend saw Chadenga clear 2,23m at the meet. The previous facility record stood at 2,15m. Chadenga is Zimbabwe’s high jump record holder with a height of 2,26m cleared and is also a three-time NJCAA champion.  20-year-old Chadenga, who is on an athletic scholarship at South Plains College in Texas is one of Zimbabwe’s brightest prospects. He is a former Prince Edward School learner. Chadenga’s record is not far from the 2024 Olympics qualifying mark of 2.32. The 2024 Olympics will be held in Paris, France. The Sport and Recreation Commission (SRC) has since sent their congratulatory message to Chadenga.
“Congratulations to our very own Zimbabwean high jump athlete, Kudakwashe Chadenga, who won the USA National Junior College Indoor Championships and managed to set a new facility record,” wrote the SRC. <img class="wp-image-536468 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/SRC.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/SRC.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/SRC-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) At the Tokyo Olympics, the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee sent just five athletes to the biggest sporting event globally, which was the second-smallest Zimbabwean team since their debut in 1928. It was no surprise that with such a tiny squad, for the third consecutive Olympiad, Zimbabwe left the games without any medals. — @innocentskizoe
