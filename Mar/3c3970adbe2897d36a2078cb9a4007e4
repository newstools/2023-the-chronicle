A TOTAL of 18 local tourism players will be participating at the International Tourism Bourse (ITB) Berlin, which begins in Germany today ending on Thursday. The Ministry of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry, together with the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA), are leading the entourage, which will use the global platform to market destination Zimbabwe. Germany is ranked second highest generator of arrivals from Europe into Zimbabwe after the United Kingdom, contributing 23 980 arrivals recorded in 2022, compared to 37 984 arrivals attained in the pre-pandemic era in 2019.  “Zimbabwe’s participation at the renowned Berlin tourism showcase this year will be supported by a robust entourage of more than 18 local tourism industry players who are keen to reposition Zimbabwe as a must-visit tourism destination in Southern Africa,” said ZTA in a statement yesterday. “The sector is poised for growth following the positive developments in the destination. As the industry recovers from the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe’s tourism has embarked on tourism recovery strategies with the aim of regaining the lost market share in varied source markets.” <img class="wp-image-683406 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-13-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-13-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-13-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu Under this drive, Tourism Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu, and his team have been involved in re-engagement efforts with international investors, the travel trade, media and the diplomatic community with a view of presenting the rebirth of Zimbabwe and the vision for a thriving economy characterised by transparency and progressive ease of doing business.
