The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter VERSATILE dance outfit Khaya Arts Productions is set to launch a school of arts with the aim of incorporating the younger generation. The school will be launched on April 12 at Tshabalala Open Arena with the first class’s students set to be drawn from Masuku, Intunta, Maphisa and Mahlabezulu schools. They will attend the school of dance, music and theatre for free as a pilot project.  Khaya Arts Productions director Future Dube said they have decided to set up a school so as to impart their knowledge to the younger ones while also keeping them off the streets at a time when the country is fighting drug and substance abuse among youths. “The main objective is to fight drug and substance abuse. We want to catch them young and help them grow their talents in the fields of dance, music and theatre.
“The students will be coming for lessons after their school programmes,” Dube said. -@mthabisi_mthire
