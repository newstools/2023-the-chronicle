Through our platform, we’ll host guys that have never performed and infuse them with experienced guys so that they share notes. We hope that this happens as a regular occurrence in the arts calendar for Stand-Up Comedy,” said MaForty. <img class="wp-image-620560 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-381.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-381.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-1-copy-381-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Theatre As a comedian, MaForty said he was inspired to introduce this initiative after drawing inspiration from live music sessions. “Musicians have listening sessions for their new creations. Taking notes from them, we’re introducing this platform for comedians to try out their jokes before taking them to bigger stages,” he said.
