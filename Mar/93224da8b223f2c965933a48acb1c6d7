FORMER Castle Premier Soccer League champions Chicken Inn left Bulawayo yesterday to engage in a five-day bonding camp in the coal mining town of Hwange. Newly appointed Gamecocks head coach Prince Matore said the camp will see them engage in two friendly matches against Southern Region Division One side ZPC Hwange today before they face Premier Soccer League returnees Hwange on Sunday at the Colliery Stadium. “With regards to our preparations for the forthcoming season, I can say so far so good. The squad is gelling up well and we are happy to welcome three youngsters Sipho Phiri, Alfa Chiwashira and Stephen Zinaka from our developmental side. The three are part of the squad that has engaged in the bonding camp together with 25 senior players,” said Matore. <img class="size-large wp-image-638413" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-28-8-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-28-8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Untitled-28-8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Castle Lager Premier Soccer League He added: “We want to cultivate a spirit of togetherness. The camp will conclude on Monday after engaging in two friendly matches against ZPC Hwange and PSL side Hwange.” After parting ways with Bret Amidu and Malvin Gaki who have since joined Manica Diamonds and Ngezi Platinum Stars respectively, nimble-footed Clive “Gringo” Dzingai, veteran midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu, stocky and pacey striker Brian Muza, goalkeepers Donovan Bernard and Pride Zendera, seasoned right back Passmore Bernard, left-footed defender Xolisani “Lolo” Ndlovu, towering duo of Vincent Moyo and Itai Mabunu, combative Richard Hachiro and Denzel Khumalo among others further committed to the Simbisa Brands sponsored outfit. At the end of last year, the Gamecocks beat Dynamos to the signature of highly rated ex-Young Warriors forward, Calum English-Brown. Fondly known as the White Lion, English-Brown impressed with his individual performances during the 2021/2022 season for Whawha.  Some of the country’s leading clubs including Highlanders and Manica Diamonds reportedly also wanted to sign English-Brown. Matore was elevated to the position of head coach early this year with the club’s 2015 championship winning coach Joey Antipas’ getting reassigned. The former, a Caf A licence holder, has over the years worked as Antipas’ lieutenant. Chicken Inn roped in ex-Bulawayo Chiefs and Bulawayo City gaffer Farai Tawarechera to assume the role of assistant coach. <img class="size-large wp-image-670386" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-14-copy-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-14-copy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-14-copy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo Chiefs players Tawarechera is also a Caf A badge holder and Antipas, a veteran gaffer who also won the league title with Motor Action and also boasts of successful coaching stints with the senior national soccer team, has a Caf B badge. Zifa implemented standardisation for local football coaching that requires all top-flight coaches to possess a Caf A licence at the beginning of the 2017 season. Standardisation of coaches meant that Premiership gaffers and their assistants must be in possession of a Caf A badge. -@FungaiMuderere
