BULAWAYO-based imbube group, Great Stars Ijongosi has partnered with Dab Three Events for the launch of their fifth album at Bulawayo Theatre later this month. Titled Ijongosi, the album comes three years after their fourth album ‘Konke Kulungile’ was released. The forthcoming album contains eight tracks, Ijongosi, Emambale, Dumazile, Caroline, Amalanda, Igomora, Amagwala, and Hamba Juba that speak on love, social, environmental and human rights issues. The group’s lead singer and director, Philani Donga said the album title was inspired by the group’s name which came from their audiences during their first days on stage.  “We’re working on building a relationship with our fans by trying to make them understand what we’re all about. The title ‘Ijongosi (a teenage bull)’ is taken from the name Great Stars – Ijongosi which we were given by audiences during our first days of performing because of the energy we exhibited on the stage,” he said. The leader said the group is hard at work rehearsing for the March 25 launch. He said the group, just like many, was established in a bid to fight unemployment among young people. And many years later, the group has gained popularity through performances at weddings and corporate events. <img class="size-large wp-image-672401" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-22-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-22-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Untitled-22-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sandra Ndebele “We’ve been selling our music on online platforms and through CDs. From the reaction and response from the audiences, we’re doing well as a group and we hope that one of the days, we’ll be able to make it on the list of internationally recognised and well-booked imbube groups,” Donga said. The eight-member group that started off as a church group in Silobela, Nkayi District was transformed into an imbube ensemble in 2011. So far, they have performed at events such as the Ibumba Arts Festival, Intwasa koBulawayo Arts Festival, Chibuku Neshamwari, Ingwebu competitions and the Bulawayo Arts Festival. <img class="size-large wp-image-620254" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-9-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-9.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Untitled-43-9-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo They have shared the stage with iconic musicians including Vusa Mkhaya, Sandra Ndebele, Zinja Ziyamluma and several Maskandi artists.
