The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CASTLE Challenge Cup champions FC Platinum and Bulawayo Chiefs gave a snippet of how their teams will play when the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League kicks off this coming weekend. The two teams gave a good account in the Castle Challenge Cup played at Mandava Stadium on Saturday, with FC Platinum who won the tie 2-0 enjoying superior ball dominance. FC Platinum, who won their fourth consecutive Castle Challenge Cup got their goals on either half from Panashe Mutimbanyoka and new signing Jarrison Selemani.  The champions also fielded defender Misheck Ngwenya who joined them from Triangle
United, with club returnee Perfect Chikwende coming in the 65th minute for Thandolwenkosi Ngwenya.
Selemani, who was substituted for Walter Musona in the 65th minute had a memorable competitive debut as he was voted Man-of-the-Match. Ngwenya fitted well at the heart of defence where he partnered Lawrence Mhlanga. <img class="wp-image-686932 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/5td.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/5td.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/5td-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lizwe Sweswe Bulawayo Chiefs Though FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza was modest about his team’s performance, saying they are “not yet there”, he probably should be happy with the way his players moved
the ball around and kept probing at Bulawayo Chiefs’ goal. Had they been clinical, FC Platinum could have won by a big margin but their box-to-box midfielder Brian Banda was guilty of fluffing at least two goal scoring opportunities.
FC Platinum were also quick to break on counters after surviving a few of Bulawayo Chiefs’ raids that The Ninjas’ coach Lizwe Sweswe felt they could have buried. <img class="wp-image-673414 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jbnkki.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jbnkki.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/jbnkki-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Perfect Chikwende FC Platinum Only six players – skipper Malvin Mkolo, Obriel Chirinda, Panashe Shoko, Mthokozisi Msebe, Felix Moyo and Billy Veremu, who were with Bulawayo Chiefs last season started, combining well with the new arrivals.
Sweswe gave club debuts to goalkeeper Issa Ali, former Manica Diamonds’ Rodrick Mufudza, veteran forward Kuda Musharu, William Stima and ex-national team midfielder Danny Phiri. Stima played the opening 10 minutes before picking up an injury and was replaced by Ben Nyahunzwi who had a decent game in central defence. As the game went on, Sweswe made a double substitution taking out Mufudza and Musharu for Dalubuhle Dlodlo and Last Jesi in search of an equaliser. Jesi showed some flashes of brilliance but 70th introduction Ayanda Ncube who replaced Moyo had a subdued game.
Sweswe hopes that his squad will improve. “I think we will do our best when the season starts. We made too many mistakes when we conceded those goals. This is the first match so concentration levels are still low,” said Sweswe.
Bulawayo Chiefs open their season account with a date against Ngezi Platinum Stars. — @ZililoR.
