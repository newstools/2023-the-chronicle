The Chronicle Reverend who claimed to be Jesus alerts police as community vow to ‘crucify’ him during Easter A Kenyan Reverend who claimed to be Jesus Christ has raised an alarm that his life is in danger following his position. The clergyman said members of his community Bungoma (yesu wa Tongaren) have vowed to crucify him during this year’s Easter just as was done to the son of God. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-686826" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-06-111320-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-06-111320.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-06-111320-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The self-proclaimed Jesus Christ reported the matter to the police when he was informed that residents of Bungoma were overheard saying he must be crucified during Easter the same way Jesus was crucified. It was gathered that members of the community assured the man of God that if he is truly the messiah, he will resurrect on the third day and go to heaven after the crucifixion so he should not worry at all. He, however, visited a police station to demand protection ahead of this year’s Easter celebration.
