The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Reporter GERMANY based-songstress Nomina has released what she has termed the first Germany-Amapiano song. Some art artists entertain, others have a far more powerful purpose and as with Nomina, the singer-songwriter, and ambassador for World Peace Berlin, her single titled “Komm Mit Mir” proves her prowess. “Komm Mit mir” is a German term that translates to “come with me”. It is a song about love that is resilient in the face of all distance and adversity. It sits comfortably in both down-tempo and South African House territories with the artiste layering her signature vocals. “You get the bombastic and always-changing shaker-driven groove of the house with the chord progression of what you’d want from an RnB song of this calibre. Komm Mit Mir is the sun-filled dance track you’d want to wind down the summer with. “The song is about long-distance love. People who love each other unconditionally, despite the distance and what people think of them. Love keeps on winning though the circumstances seem difficult,” said Nomina. – @mthabisi_mthire
