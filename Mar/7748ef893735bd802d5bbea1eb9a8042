Umkhathi Theatre Works bagged its third National Arts Merit Award (Nama) last Saturday in honour of their play titled Bayethe. The play was nominated under the Outstanding Theatrical Production category alongside competitive plays, Heartbreak Mafia by Reps and The Play That Goes Wrong. Play director, Matesu Dube and one of the actors Ishmael Muvingi were also nominated for the Outstanding Director and Outstanding Actor awards respectively. <img class="size-large wp-image-602532" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-49-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-49-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/Untitled-49-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Namas Dube said they were very proud to have represented the City of Kings well at the awards by bringing the award home. “Winning the award gave us a sense of pride as creatives for being able to bring the gong home. We’ve received immense support from the city of Bulawayo whose people have been our audiences and clients for our work. “This has challenged us to produce more works of the same standard or even beyond so that we continue getting such recognition, locally and internationally,” Dube said.  Bayethe, a play that narrates the last days of King Lobengula, is the first play by the group to win an award, standing out from their previous theatrical plays, Ihloka by Thabani Hillary Moyo and Warrior written by Christopher Mlalazi. Previously, the group boasted of two Namas which were in recognition of their outstanding dance performances. Dube has two of his own as a director including a Nama legends gong.
