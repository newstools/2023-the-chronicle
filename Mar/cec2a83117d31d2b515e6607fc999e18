Remember we have a football academy and an academic institution Ivinar Park Academy hence we thought of juggling our executive as we intended to see it have a more academic thrust. It’s all in an effort to align ourselves to the vision of the academic institution,” said Sinyosi, a retired educationist who was the headmaster of Filabusi Primary School for 21 years. He also doubles up as Ivinar Park Academy school co-ordinator.  — @FungaiMuderere
