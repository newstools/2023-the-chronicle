Chiwandire, known by stage name “Take Money” is happy that her opponent has signed the fight contract and expressed her gratitude to her sponsors. “Firstly, I would like to thank sponsors KGK, Pumping World and Invictus Gym who have made all this dream possible by backing me. To the fans, the moment we’ve been waiting for has arrived as we are now in possession of the signed contracts and we have the date which is 18 March 2023. Now I’m waiting to go there and bring the belt home.  “I know the fight will be difficult, but I’ve got some tricks under my sleeve. I’ve watched her games, analysed them and I know what’s required of me to win the games. What I know is that she won’t last 10 rounds,” said a confident Chiwandire.
The Zimbabwean boxer who got shot at the WBC Gold belt after defeating Mexican challenger Zulina Munoz at the Harare International Conference Centre last year in October, said planning for that fight was more difficult than Mercado’s. “I think ratings matter little here because we are both going there with our confidence high, but I’ll say this fight isn’t as difficult as the last. I’ve watched more videos and know Yamleth’s strengths and weaknesses. I know what I’m stepping up to. It’s going to be a challenging fight that I’m confident to conquer,” said Chiwandire. <img class="wp-image-651721 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-13-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-13-5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Untitled-13-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kudakwashe Chiwandire Winning against Munoz lifted Chiwandire’s ratings to sixth out of 168.

She’ll be wrapping up her preparations and we’re confident of a good trip,” Musonda said. – @ZililoR.
