So we are going to be taking our council teams to the wards so that they understand how the council implements its billing,” said Clr Ncube. “They will also address queries from residents who have concerns over their bills. On the other hand, we want to explain our debt collection and credit policy. We are going to be explaining how the council handles debts and explain the procedures in terms of debt collection.” Clr Ncube said council will educate the residents on the steps it takes to disconnect water to defaulting residents.
BCC is owed $36 billion by its debtors and these include domestic, commercial and Government departments while it owes its creditors $10 billion.  Clr Ncube said council also wants to get feedback from residents on how it should deal with the Bulawayo Power Station. “We want to get input from residents on how to deal with the power station issue. We understand that Zimbabwe Power Company has attracted an investor in the development of the power station,” he said. “The power station belongs to the city and therefore, we want to have feedback from the owners of the station so that they decide whether we sell it to ZPC or run it under a joint partnership.”–@nqotshili
