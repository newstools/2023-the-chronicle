The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya in Beitbridge TWO sisters were burnt to death when a house they were sleeping in caught fire in the Vhembe-view suburb yesterday.
The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained and police are investigating the matter. It is reported that tragedy struck when the Chapasuka sisters were sleeping in their rented house at around 1AM.
The fire was noticed by neighbours who rushed to the scene and extinguished it but unfortunately the two had succumbed to the burns. The police officer commanding Beitbridge District, Chief Superintendent Tichaona Nyongo confirmed the incident last night.
He identified the deceased as Everjoy Chapasuka (30) and Sandra Chapasuka whose age is not known at this stage, who were biological sisters. The two women, he said, were staying with Phillani Mkothamo who is married to one of them.

Later on the following morning around 0045 hours, a neighbour who was bathing at his house heard an explosion.” Chief Supt Nyongo said the neighbour went to investigate the source of the explosion.
