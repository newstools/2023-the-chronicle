FORMER national team defender Kevin Moyo has been named as one of the captains for Dynamos Football Club. The Moyo twin, a new arrival at DeMbare was named as the second vice-captain, deputising skipper Frank Makarati and right back Emanuel Jalai. Moyo, who boasts of experience having had playing stints locally, in South Africa and Zambia, is one of the senior players at Dynamos.  The ex-FC Platinum, Chippa United and Bulawayo Chiefs central defender has fitted well at Dynamos, forming a formidable partnership at the heart of defence with Makarati. On Sunday, Moyo, a Highlanders junior product and Makarati twinned in central defence with Jalai starting at right back while Elvis Moyo was thrown into the fray at left back when Dynamos beat
Dulivhadzimu United 2-0 in Beitbridge. Announcing the captains yesterday, DeMbare, who have set-up a four-day training camp at the border town also held a financial literacy session for its players at Mabidi Sports Arena in rural Beitbridge. <img class="wp-image-686938 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/67trgf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/67trgf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/67trgf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Emmanuel Jalai Besides training and having a bonding session in Beitbridge, Dynamos have also invited former FC Platinum’s juniors’ central defender Meki Meki who had a great game for Dulivhadzimu United against DeMbare for trials. The towering 21-year-old Meki is blessed with a good body and skill, which has made him a Dynamos target, will train with DeMbare before the Glamour Boys leave Beitbridge on Wednesday.
DeMbare coach Herbert Maruwa confirmed interest in Meki. “I was charmed by Meki and as we wrap up our preseason preparations, I’ll like to have a close look at the player while here in Beitbridge. He is young, talented from what I saw in the game. I can’t say whether we will sign him or not, but like I said, I’ll love to have a look at him,” said Maruwa. <img class="wp-image-686939 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/676666666666667.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/676666666666667.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/676666666666667-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Frank Makarati Dynamos captain Dulivhadzimu United coach Stanley Ncube said Meki, who recently joined them from FC Platinum’s development side is a key player who they want to keep in their quest to challenge for the Central Region Soccer League title. Ncube said they are bracing up for a possible loss of Meki, whose talent cannot be kept in Beitbridge. “I believe that Dynamos’ indication that they want to have a look at Meki is a sign that the player is exceptionally talented. He has a good work ethic and to us he is one of the key members of our squad. I know that he won’t stay long in the first division, but we never expected that he’ll catch the interest of Dynamos this early. Even against Highlanders last month, Meki had a standout performance. If he goes, then that is a plus for the young talent,” said Ncube. — @ZililoR
