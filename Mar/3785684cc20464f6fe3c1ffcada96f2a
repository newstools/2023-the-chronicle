The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo, Business Reporter THE Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in Mashonaland East, Apolonia Munzverengi has said it is imperative for the proposed new Mines and Mineral Bill to empower small-scale miners by pegging registration fees at affordable levels and harmonise arms of Government that collect levies. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Mines and Mining Development is conducting public hearings on the Mines and Mining Amendment Bill. The Bill, which was gazetted early February will among several issues seek to reconstitute the composition of the Mining Affairs Board and clarify its functions, establish the Mining Cadastre Register and Registry, and reduce the classes of Mining Titles to three only as well as regulate the activities of prospectors. In her contribution during a stakeholder engagement in Bulawayo on Monday, Minister Munzverengi said small-scale miners need empowerment as they are contributing much to the output of minerals yet they are not given a level playing field. Small to medium-scale miners continue to lead the pack in terms of production volumes after they delivered a cumulative 19,98 tons in January to October 2022 up from 12,95 tons in the same period in 2022.  As such, Minister Munzverengi said there is a need to empower small-scale miners.
“When it comes to licensing, the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development has its rates, followed by registration, and inspections. “The local authorities have their own fees. There is the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) and Environmental Management Authority (EMA). All go to the artisanal miners. Are we providing a user-friendly environment to the small miners, are they able to mine?” said Minister Munzwerengi.  <img class="size-large wp-image-625417" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-42-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Environmental Management Authority (EMA) “Is it possible that we have a provision in the Act that registration fees for the local artisanal miners should be different from a foreign investor? If we want to empower our people it should be included in the Bill on how best we can cater for our people to enable them to pay.” In previous consultation meetings, small-scale miners also raised the duplication of various fees to several arms of Government which they said is crippling their operations. Various stakeholders also said to empower local miners there is a need to promote the value addition of minerals, which will see local miners partner with foreign investors. Also covered during the engagement meeting are issues to do with transparency in the licensing regime of mining titles, recognition of provincial mining directors, and devolution of mining sector administration royalty, equality and equity of mining fees across provinces and local authorities. — @SikhulekelaniM1
