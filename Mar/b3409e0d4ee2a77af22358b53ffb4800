A total of six matches will be played between the teams over three days at Harare Sports Club. Southerns will take on Glamorgan in the first match of the series this morning before Northerns go up against Durham in the afternoon. Tomorrow, Southerns will face Durham in the first fixture, while Northerns will play Glamorgan in the second.  The last two T20 matches are scheduled for Friday, with Southerns and Glamorgan clashing first before Northerns meet Durham again.
