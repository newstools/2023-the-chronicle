THE Bulawayo City Council has made a dramatic U-turn on a proposal to partner with Government in constructing small to medium enterprise (SME) workspaces in Bulawayo, claiming it has the capacity — including finances — to go it alone. Following the destruction of Mpopoma Outspan Market, which was razed by fire leaving over 200 SMEs with no space to operate from, the local authority pledged to avail about 1,4 hectares of land for SME workspaces. <img class="size-large wp-image-685870" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/vdfgfdg-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/vdfgfdg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/vdfgfdg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mpopoma Outspan Market According to a full council monthly report tabled on Wednesday, the local authority identified two industrial stands in Kelvin East measuring approximately 1,4 hectares and were considered adequate to establish an SMEs centre. The market could accommodate some of the SMEs who used to operate at Mpopoma Outspan Market, and other SMEs who were looking for suitable spaces to operate from. However, the two stands are within an area that was not serviced and required the construction of roads, water and sewer mains extensions to service the area. <img class="size-large wp-image-685869" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hgfjjkl-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hgfjjkl.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/hgfjjkl-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Town Planning Department had advised that the cost of servicing the area was estimated at US$297 772.53,” town clerk, Mr Christopher Dube, told the finance and development committee.
