Meet 62-year-old Miss Ntombizodwa Silonda, a retired artist and designer who never realised her potential until later in life. As a child, she attended art and craft lessons at the Mzilikazi Art and Craft Centre but never considered it as a potential career. However, with the encouragement of her parents, Ntombizodwa enrolled in an art and craft design course at the youth centre, and her talent soon began to flourish. <img class="size-large wp-image-688444" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tyfvvbh-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tyfvvbh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tyfvvbh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> After finishing college, Ntombizodwa landed a job as a textile designer at Merlin Towels, but she felt unfulfilled and continued to pursue her passion for art. In 1986, she applied for a job at the National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe, and she was eventually hired as a junior artist. Through hard work and determination, Ntombizodwa rose through the ranks to become the Chief Exhibitions Officer and National Co-ordinator before retiring in 2020.
