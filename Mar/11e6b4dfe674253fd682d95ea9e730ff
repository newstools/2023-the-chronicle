The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwean Embassy in South Africa is set to conduct physical meetings with holders of Zimbabwe Exemption Permits as part of the mapping exercise in preparation for their return home starting next Monday until April 1. Nearly 180 000 ZEP holders are set to return home in June after South Africa opted against renewing their permits in 2021. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-687214" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/1-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/1-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/1-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Last month the embassy directed that ZEP holders who want to be assisted, register online in line with the mapping exercise.

It warned members of the public from engaging third parties as it has not incorporated any agents. “The Zimbabwe Embassy in Pretoria and the two Consulates in Johannesburg and Cape Town do not have agents who act on their behalf. Anyone purporting to be such is a fraudster. Members of the public are strongly urged to verify facts with the Embassy and the Consulates through the above-listed contact numbers,” reads the statement. -@nqotshili
