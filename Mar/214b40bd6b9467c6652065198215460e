The Chronicle Sikhulekelani Moyo/ Thokozile Mbedzi, Business Reporters THE drive towards the attainment of an upper middle-income economy vision by 2030 would not be complete without the full participation of women in the mainstream economy. In order to ensure the realisation of this potential, the Government is committed to continued support for women entrepreneurs through enhanced policy and facilitating improved access to funding, among others. Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, said this in Bulawayo on Saturday when she met entrepreneurs during the inaugural ‘Esteemed Bulawayo Businesswomen High Tea’ event. <img class="wp-image-685467 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tyhyyy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tyhyyy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tyhyyy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Minister, Dr Sithembiso Nyoni, The platform brought businesswomen, financial services providers, tax authorities, and other stakeholders to network and share insights as well as learn about the legal processes of setting up a business. The minister was the guest of honour and utilised the event to conscientise delegates about the Government’s efforts to transform Zimbabwe in line with Vision 2030 and challenged women to play their part as they are a majority gender. According to the 2022 population and housing census results, Zimbabwe has about 15 million people of whom 7,3 million are males and 7,9 million are women. The report shows women constitute 52 percent of the population.
As such, Dr Nyoni said President Mnangagwa’s administration was keen to empower women so as to unlock their economic potential.  “To obtain Vision 2030, we can’t do it without uplifting women because women have a large population and they occupy the bottom space at the economic pyramid,” said the minister.
“I’m sure those who have listened to His Excellency’s speech, he is very keen that women in Zimbabwe are empowered and they are included. That’s why he has put in my ministry four funding entities so that we ensure women are financed.” The Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development already houses the Women Micro-finance Bank, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Corporation (SMEDCO), Zimbabwe Community Development Fund, and the Women Development Fund, all meant to finance women-led projects from different levels. <img class="wp-image-682635 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-1-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-1-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Untitled-1-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa Dr Nyoni challenged women entrepreneurs to fully utilise the available funding platforms saying despite lengthy due diligence processes, women should not give up.
If women are empowered, Dr Nyoni said the country will progress faster and have more peace and stability in families, which helps to reduce gender-based violence. “This initiative will help to drive the business community forward and definitely reflect a truly people-centred community that leaves no one and no place behind and looks to the future,” said the minister. She commended the event organisers for complementing Government’s effort to empower women in the economy by increasing business opportunities through knowledge sharing, skills development and promoting women’s leadership. <img class="wp-image-685480 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tryhtfh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tryhtfh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/tryhtfh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Sipho Mazibuko Dr Nyoni also urged women to scale up partnerships and create more support groups to enhance their chances to access funds as well as assist each other morally. Event host, Ms Sipho Mazibuko, paid tribute to the Government for its commitment to assisting women to participate in the mainstream economy. She urged Dr Nyoni to facilitate the registration of women-led businesses under the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe so that they participate in public tenders.
“The event went well, and the turnout wasn’t what we anticipated, this means women are willing to be empowered and learn more,” said Ms Mazibuko. <img class="wp-image-625594 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-119.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-119.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Untitled-1-copy-119-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Vision 2030 Vendors who attended the event also commended the networking initiative saying this will allow them to grow as they are able to learn from others.
They also said bringing service providers to them through conference events will allow them to understand some of the doing business protocols. “I’m happy that I learnt something new from the Zimra officials, and also I now know how to access some funding through different platforms,” said one of the participants, Ms Evelyn Ncube. — @SikhulekelaniM1
